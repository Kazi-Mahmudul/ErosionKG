prompt_template: |
  Extract knowledge graph triplets from the following text about landscape erosion.
  Each triplet should be in the format: (subject, relationship, object)

  Focus on extracting entities like:
  - Erosion processes (e.g., sheet erosion, gully erosion, rill erosion)
  - Landforms (e.g., slopes, valleys, watersheds)
  - Factors (e.g., rainfall, soil type, vegetation cover)
  - Metrics (e.g., soil loss rate, erosion index, R-factor)
  - Regions (e.g., geographic locations, study areas)

  Use relationships like:
  - CAUSES, AFFECTS, MODULATES, MEASURES, OCCURS_IN, ACTS_ON, COMPOSED_OF

  Return ONLY a JSON array of triplets. Example format:
  [{{"subject": "rainfall intensity", "relationship": "CAUSES", "object": "sheet erosion"}}]

  If no clear triplets can be extracted, return an empty array: []

  TEXT:
  {text}
