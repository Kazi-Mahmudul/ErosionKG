Soil erosion is a major problem around the world because of its effects on soil productivity, nutrient loss, siltation in water bodies, and degradation of water quality. By understanding the driving forces behind soil erosion, we can more easily identify erosion-prone areas within a landscape to address the problem strategically. Soil erosion models have been used to assist in this task. One of the most commonly used soil erosion models is the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its family of models: the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation version 2 (RUSLE2), and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE). This paper reviews the different sub-factors of USLE and RUSLE, and analyses how different studies around the world have adapted the equations to local conditions. We compiled these studies and equations to serve as a reference for other researchers working with (R)USLE and related approaches. Within each sub-factor section, the strengths and limitations of the different equations are discussed, and guidance is given as to which equations may be most appropriate for particular climate types, spatial resolution, and temporal scale."

We investigate some of the limitations of existing (R)USLE formulations, such as uncertainty issues given the simple empirical nature of the model and many of its sub-components; uncertainty issues around data availability; and its inability to account for soil loss from gully erosion, mass wasting events, or predicting potential sediment yields to streams. Recommendations on how to overcome some of the uncertainties associated with the model are given. Several key future directions to refine it are outlined: e.g. incorporating soil loss from other types of soil erosion, estimating soil loss at sub-annual temporal scales, and compiling consistent units for the future literature to reduce confusion and errors caused by mismatching units. The potential of combining (R)USLE with the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) and sediment delivery ratio (SDR) to account for gully erosion and sediment yield to streams respectively is discussed. Overall, the aim of this paper is to review the (R)USLE and its sub-factors, and to elucidate the caveats, limitations, and recommendations for future applications of these soil erosion models. We hope these recommendations will help researchers more robustly apply (R)USLE in a range of geoclimatic regions with varying data availability, and modelling different land cover scenarios at finer spatial and temporal scales (e.g. at the field scale with different cropping options).\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nSoil erosion involves many processes, but the overall effect is of particles being transported and deposited from one location to another. Although it occurs naturally, soil erosion is often exacerbated by anthropogenic activities (Adornado et al., 2009). Soil erosion is affected by wind, rainfall and associated runoff processes, vulnerability of soil to erosion, and the characteristics of land cover and management (David, 1988; Aksoy and Kavvas, 2005; Panagos et al., 2015e). Understanding and mitigating erosion and associated degradation is critical because of its possible effects: nutrient loss, river and reservoir siltation, water quality degradation, and decreases in soil productivity (Bagherzadeh, 2014).

Benavidez et al.: A review of the (Revised) Universal Soil Loss Equation ((R)USLE)\n\nAsia, South America, and Africa with an average of 30 to 40 tha-1 year-1 and an average of 17 tha-1 year 1 for the United States of America and Europe. For comparison, the soil erosion rate for undisturbed forests was reported to range from 0.004 to 0.05 tha-1 year-¹ globally (Pimentel et al., 1995). Within a landscape, erosion due to water can be caused by unconcentrated flow (sheet), occur within channels of concentrated flow (rills and gullies), and occur through raindrop impact and overland flow (inter-rill) (Aksoy and Kavvas, 2005; Morgan, 2005). Land management can be improved through understanding how these erosion processes occur and what areas are vulnerable to soil loss. Advances in technology such as the development of soil erosion models and increases in computing power for spatial analysis have assisted in making soil erosion modelling faster and more accurate.\n\nSoil erosion models aid land management by helping elucidate the areas vulnerable to soil erosion in the baseline scenario, potential erosion rates, and possible causes of soil erosion. They range from relatively simple empirical models, and conceptual models, to more complicated physics-based models (Merritt et al., 2003). Like any other model, there are uncertainties associated with soil erosion models that cannot account for all the complex interactions of sediment delivery. Hence, unless extensive parameterisation and validation against observed data are accomplished, soil loss rates from models should be taken as best available estimates instead of absolute values (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). Extensive reviews of soil erosion models of varying complexity have been done before but tend to focus on input requirements and applications (Aksoy and Kavvas, 2005; Merritt et al., 2003). A review by de Vente and Posen (2005) differs by focusing on semi-quantitative models that include different types of soil erosion in order to estimate basin sediment yield. Other reviews have focused on the use of different types of soil erosion models in particular places, such as Brazilian watersheds for de Mello et al. (2016)."

(2016).\n\nOne family of empirical soil loss models is the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) suite of models, including the original USLE, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation version 2 (RUSLE2), and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE). The USLE is an empirical model used to estimate the annual average rate of soil erosion (tons per unit area) for a given combination of crop system, management practice, soil type, rainfall pattern, and topography. It was originally developed at the plot scale for agricultural plots in the United States of America (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). An updated form of USLE (RUSLE) was published to include new rainfall erosivity maps for the United States of America and improvements to the method of calculating the different USLE factors (Renard et al., 1997). RUSLE added changes in soil erodibility due to freeze-thaw and soil moisture, a method for calculating cover and management factors, changes to how the influence of topography is incorporated into the model, and updated values to represent soil conservation practices (Renard and Freimund, 1994). The RUSLE2 framework is a computer interface programmed to handle more complex field situations, including an updated database of factors (Foster et al., 2003). These three variations of (R)USLE measure soil loss per unit area at an annual timescale. The MUSLE is an extension to work at finer temporal resolution, using runoff and peak flow rate to estimate event-based soil loss (Sadeghi et al., 2014). These models have been used around the world due to their relative simplicity and seemingly low data requirements (Table A1).\n\nThis simplicity of the (R)USLE has been integrated into more complex soil erosion models to help with management and decision-making, including the Agricultural Non-Point Source model (AGNPS), the Chemical Runoff and Erosion from Agricultural Management Systems model (CREAMS), and the Sediment River Network model (SedNet) (Aksoy and Kavvas, 2005; de Vente and Poesen, 2005; Merritt et al., 2003)."

The usage of (R)USLE in large models is mainly for the purpose of assisting with decision-making, such as prioritising land use objectives in the Philippines (Bantayan and Bishop, 1998), scenario analysis for water quality in catchments in New Zealand (Rodda et al., 2001), or delineating unique soil landscapes in Australia (Yang et al., 2007).\n\nExtensive reviews of soil erosion modelling and types of soil erosion models have been published that briefly discuss the (R)USLE as an empirical model, elements of which are commonly incorporated into more complex conceptual or physics-based soil erosion models (Aksoy and Kavvas, 2005; de Vente and Poesen, 2005; Merritt et al., 2003). This review is more specific to the (R)USLE and addresses the complexity of its different sub-factors, as well as the issues for researchers to consider before applying (R)USLE to their study area. These issues include equation choices, digital elevation model (DEM) resolution, granularity in land cover characteristics, scale, etc. The MUSLE is not included in this review because Sadeghi et al. (2014) have already done an extensive review of the model and event-scale estimates are beyond the scope of this paper. Annual estimates of soil loss are useful for understanding the baseline erosion in a catchment, but intra-annual and event-based soil loss estimates are useful for elucidating temporal variations in erosion. Performing event-based soil loss modelling is important for areas that frequently experience extreme events as these can cause large-scale sediment transport and mass wasting.\n\nThis paper discusses the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the USLE model family. Although alternative sub-factor equations are presented, we also discuss questions of suitability that future users should consider before applying these models.

Hence, applying the USLE family of models to soils and sites exceeding these limits requires careful parameterisation of the model and being mindful of the increased uncertainty in model predictions.\n\nIn the original development of the model, this farm plot is called the \"unit plot\" and is defined as a plot that is 22.1 m long, is 1.83 m wide, and has a slope of 9 % (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978)."

The uncertainties in soil erosion modelling stem from the availability of long-term reliable data, including issues of temporal resolution (e.g. < 30 min resolution required for (R)USLE) and the availability of spatial data over a catchment. This issue is not unique to (R)USLE applications and is generally worse when applying more complex models with larger numbers of variables and more detailed data requirements (de Vente and Poesen, 2005; Hernandez et al., 2012). Hence, the ubiquitous usage of the (R)USLE can be attributed to its relatively low data requirements compared to more complex soil loss models, making it potentially easier to apply in areas with scarce data. Another limitation of the (R)USLE and arguably many erosion model applications is the lack of validation data with which to verify model outputs, which is discussed further in Sect. 4.\n\nAlthough the application of the (R)USLE seems to be a simple linear equation at first glance, this review addresses the complex equations that go into calculating its sub-factors, such as rainfall erosivity, which requires detailed pluviographic data (<30 min resolution).\n\n2.1 Rainfall erosivity factor (R)\n\nThe R factor represents the effect that rainfall has on soil erosion and was included after observing sediment deposits after an intense storm (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978).

The imperial units of erosivity are in hundreds of foot ton- force (tonf) inch per acre per hour per year, and multiplying by 17.02 will give the SI units of megajoule millimetre per hectare per hour per year (Renard et al., 1997).\n\nWith the body of work that has been done in rainfall erosivity, some studies have managed to construct rainfall erosivity maps over large countries and regions. Panagos et al. (2017) have used pluviographic data from 63 countries to calculate rainfall erosivity and spatially interpolated the results to construct a global rainfall erosivity map at 30 arcsec resolution. Despite its coarse resolution, this global dataset can be used as a resource for rainfall erosivity in data-sparse regions. For the United States, Renard et al. (1997) details the procedure for obtaining rainfall erosivity values from their large national database. Renard et al. (1997) would be the recommended reference for study areas in the United States because of the extensive database that already exists for that country. For the European Union, Panagos et al. (2015d) constructed a rainfall erosivity map at 1 km resolution and published descriptive statistics for R values in each of the member countries. The interpolated map showed good agreement through cross-validation and to previous studies, but areas that had fewer rainfall stations and more diverse terrain caused higher prediction uncertainty (Panagos et al., 2015d). Using a large rainfall dataset, da Silva (2004) constructed a spatially interpolated map of R factors in Brazil whose trends showed agreement with previous work on rainfall erosivity in the country.\n\nIn areas that only have annual precipitation available, several equations and their studies can be used as a reference.

      "content": "In their global application, Naipal et al. (2015) published different R-factor equations depending on a study area's climate classification. One caveat is that the data for these equations had a large percentage of USA and European records, so resulting accuracy of R factors might be better for those locations (Naipal et al., 2015). In tropical areas such as Southeast Asia, the R factor by El-Swaify et al. (1987) as cited in Merritt et al. (2004) was used extensively in Thailand, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. However, the units for the R factor in this equation are given as metric tons per hectare per year, which do not correspond to the original units used by (R)USLE (Merritt et al., 2004). This lack of consistency regarding units is not uncommon in the reviewed literature, which sometimes fails to explicitly report the units used for the different factors. For example, Renard and Freimund (1994) report that the units of R-factor equations by Arnoldus (1977) were presumed to be in metric units. By being clear and consistent about units in the (R)USLE literature, future researchers can be more certain about the accuracy of their borrowed R-factor equations instead of presuming the units to be the same as the original\n(R)USLE. Work by Bonilla and Vidal (2011) produced an R-factor equation for Chile and published erosivity values similar to those produced by work in areas of similar geography and geology. For New Zealand, Klik et al. (2015) proposed equations for calculating the annual R factor and seasonal R factor with coefficients that change depending on the study area's location within the country.\n\nThe usage of monthly precipitation data to determine the R factor is due to monthly rainfall data being more readily available compared to detailed storm records (Renard and Freimund, 1994). Although annual rainfall estimates are sufficient, using monthly rainfall data to construct sub-annual R factors and then aggregating those R factors to an annual scale is useful in sites with large temporal variability in rainfall. Renard and Freimund (1994) used data from 155 stations with known R factors based on the original USLE approach and related their R factors to observed annual and monthly precipitation."

      "content": "Renard and Freimund (1994) used data from 155 stations with known R factors based on the original USLE approach and related their R factors to observed annual and monthly precipitation. These equations developed by Renard and Freimund (1994) on the west coast of USA were used in Ecuador (Ochoa-Cueva et al., 2015), and Honduras and El Salvador (Kim et al., 2005). Work by Arnoldus (1980) developed R-factor equations in West Africa that use monthly and annual precipitation. However, as described earlier, these equations present a problem in terms of consistent units. In Southeast Asia, Shamsad et al. (2008) developed an R-factor equation in Malaysia that was used in the Philippines by Delgado and Canters (2012). In New Zealand, the monthly precipitation can be aggregated to seasonal precipitation and used in the equation for seasonal R factor derived by Klik et al. (2015).\n\nMonthly or better precipitation records are very useful in (R)USLE applications because of the option of estimating soil loss at a monthly or seasonal scale, which can be useful in countries with high temporal variation of rainfall throughout the year. Monthly and seasonal erosion has been estimated by varying the R factor depending on the monthly precipitation while leaving all the other factors constant (Ferreira and Panagopoulos, 2014; Kavian et al., 2011). Klik et al. (2015) emphasised the need to understand the drivers of soil erosion, including whether rainfall intensity had a stronger effect compared to mean annual rainfall. In an assessment of spatial and temporal variations in rainfall erosivity over New Zealand, December and January were associated with higher erosivities, while August was associated with lowest erosivity (Klik et al., 2015). Similar work by Diodato (2004) has cited the use of monthly erosivity data to be more useful with respect to managing crop growing cycles and tillage practices, especially during seasons where high rainfall erosivity is expected. In locations where there is a large temporal variation in rainfall throughout the year, the seasonal approach of estimating soil erosion is more important for sustainable land management (Ferreira and Panagopoulos, 2014)\nTo examine how different R-factor equations affected predicted soil erosion rates over the same study site, Be-\n\nHydrol.

      "content": "navidez (2018) tested three different equations over the ~ 157 km² Mangatarere watershed in New Zealand. The equa- tions by Klik et al. (2015) developed in New Zealand, along with the equations by Loureiro and Coutinho (2001) and Fer- reira and Panagopolous (2014) developed in Portugal, were used to estimate annual and seasonal erosivity (Fig. 1 and Table 1). All three equations consider and predict seasonal erosivity, are from similar latitudes, and were developed in temperate to semi-arid environments. For the same set of rainfall data, the three equations predicted different annual and seasonal values of erosivity. Regarding seasonal patterns of erosivity, Klik et al. (2015) predicted highest erosivity occurring during summer but lowest in winter and spring. This trend matches the national observations of the most erosive storms occurring during summer and the least ero- sive storms occurring during winter (Klik et al., 2015). By contrast, both Loureiro and Coutinho (2001) and Ferreira and Panagopolous (2014) predicted highest erosivity during spring and lowest during summer. This variation is thought to be due to the Portugal equations excluding days below 10.0 mm of rainfall, which introduces a bias towards the ero- sive effects of short, intense rainfall events while potentially excluding the erosive power of longer but less intense rain- fall events. It is unsurprising that the New Zealand approach performed best in a New Zealand climate, but it does demon- strate the risk of arbitrarily transferring equations between countries, even when geoclimatic conditions are not terribly dissimilar.\n\nThese differences highlight the importance of understand- ing the regional applicability of rainfall erosivity equations. In the reviewed (R)USLE studies for this section, a common occurrence was using equations derived in different countries and regions without much justification regarding why those equations were chosen with little consideration for their suit- ability. These studies also did not publish any testing of how different R factors produce different erosivity values from the same input dataset. The purpose of testing the different R factors is to illustrate this variation and encourages future users of (R)USLE to do the same sensitivity testing in their area."

The erosivity dataset produced by Panagos et al. (2017) is rec- ommended for areas with no rainfall data or in ungauged catchments since this is a raster dataset with global cover- age (~30 arcsec resolution) and is freely available. For areas in the European Union, work by Panagos et al. (2015d) has produced a rainfall erosivity map with regional coverage at ~ 1 km resolution. These datasets can also be used to vali- date the erosivity factors calculated at the national or catch- ment scale. For study areas in which annual precipitation and the Köppen-Geiger classification are known, Naipal et al. (2015) has published rainfall erosivity equations and val- ues for 17 different climate zones.

      "content": "R. Benavidez et al.: A review of the (Revised) Universal Soil Loss Equation ((R)USLE)\n\nDas (2010) for India. For arid areas, Arnoldus (1980) as cited in Renard and Freimund (1994) has derived erosivity equations for Morocco and other locations in West Africa. Many other equations are found in Table 2, and choosing several for sensitivity testing is recommended for future (R)USLE applications. It is also important to test against observed data or R factors derived by previous applications in the same study area or in study areas with similar climatic regimes.\n\n2.2 Soil erodibility factor (K)\n\nThe K factor represents the influence of different soil properties on the slope's susceptibility to erosion (Renard et al., 1997). It is defined as the \"mean annual soil loss per unit of rainfall erosivity for a standard condition of bare soil, recently tilled up-and-down slope with no conservation practice\" (Morgan, 2005). The K factor essentially represents the soil loss that would occur on the (R)USLE unit plot, which is a plot that is 22.1 m long, is 1.83 m wide, and has a slope of 9% (Lopez-Vicente et al., 2008).\n\nHigher K-factor values indicate the soil's higher susceptibility to soil erosion (Adornado et al., 2009). In the (R)USLE, Wischmeier and Smith (1978) and Renard et al. (1997) use an equation that relates textural information, organic matter, information about the soil structure, and profile permeability with the K factor or soil erodibility factor. However, other soil classifications might not include soil structure and profile permeability information that matches the information required by (R)USLE nomograph. Hence, alternative equations have been developed that exclude the soil structure and profile permeability (Table 3). The question of which equation to use depends on the availability of soil data. Where only the textural class and organic matter content are known, Stewart et al. (1975) have approximated K-factor values based on these inputs. Similar to the R factor, the imperial units of soil erodibility are in ton acre hour per hundreds of acres per foot per tonf per inch."

      "content": "(1975) have approximated K-factor values based on these inputs. Similar to the R factor, the imperial units of soil erodibility are in ton acre hour per hundreds of acres per foot per tonf per inch. Multiplying by 0.1317 gives the erodibility in SI units of metric tons hectare hour per hectare per megajoule per millimetre (Renard et al., 1997).\n\nAlthough seemingly relatively straightforward, the K-factor equation proposed by Wischmeier and Smith (1978) comes with a few limitations regarding soil type. This equation was developed using data from medium-textured surface soils in the Midwestern USA, with an upper silt fraction limit of 70% (Renard et al., 1997). An equation for volcanic soils in Hawaii was proposed by El-Swaify and Dangler (1976) as cited in Renard et al. (1997) but is only appropriate for soils similar to Hawaiian soils and not for all tropical soils. Despite these limitations, many studies outside the USA have used the original Wischmeier and Smith (1978) K-factor equation (Table 3). Being aware of the regional specificity of K-factor equations is important, and using different K-factor equations in one study area to find a range of soil erodibility could be a way of testing their applicability.\n\nSimilar to the sensitivity analysis of the R-factor equations, testing different K-factor equations to see the variation in erodibility values and then comparing these K factors with published values from similar soils would be a good way to test applicability. For the spatial coverage of the European Union, a soil erodibility raster dataset (~ 500 m resolution) is available for validation (Panagos et al., 2014). David (1988) and Dymond (2010) have published K-factor values for soils of different textural classes (e.g. clay, loam) that can be used if only soil texture is known (Tables 4 and 5). However, the values published by Dymond (2010) are broad and do not account for soils with mixed texture, while the values of David (1988) are based on soils in the Philippines. Like the R factor, it is important to check the derived K-factor values for the site-specific soil against previously published K-factor values for comparable sites and soil types."

The USLE method of calculating the slope length and steepness factor was originally applied at the unit plot and field scale, and the RUSLE extended this to the one-dimensional hill slope scale, with different equations depending on whether the slope had a gradient of more than 9% (Renard et al., 1997; Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). Further research extends the LS factor to topographically complex units using a method that incorporates contributing area and flow accumulation (Desmet and Govers, 1996). The USLE and RUSLE method of calculating the LS factor uses slope length, angle, and a parameter that depends on the steepness of the slope in percent (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978).\n\nOne of the criticisms of the original USLE method of calculating LS factor is its limited applicability to complex topography. With advances in GIS technology, the method of determining the LS factor as a function of upslope contributing area or flow accumulation and slope has risen in popularity (Table 6). The use of DEMs to calculate the upslope contributing area and the resulting LS factor allows researchers to account for more topographically complex landscapes (Moore and Burch, 1986; Desmet and Govers, 1996). Desmet and Govers (1996) have also built on this method through showing its application in a GIS environment over topographically complex terrain when compared to the original method proposed by Wischmeier and Smith (1978). This method of using flow accumulation for slope length and steepness explicitly accounts for convergence and divergence of flow, which is important when considering soil erosion over a complex landscape (Wilson and Gallant, 2000). It is possible to use this method to calculate the LS factor over a large extent, but a high-resolution DEM is needed for accurate representation of the topography."

Morgan (2005) and David (1988) have reported values for the different growth stages of the same types of trees. A simple method of creating a C-factor layer is by using lookup tables to assign C-factor values to the land cover classes present in the study area. When using C factors from the literature, it is important to note that the definition of land cover type between two countries may vary. For example, land classified as forest in one country may be different in terms of vegetation cover or type compared to forest in another country (e.g. differences in pine forests and tropical forests). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the differences between land cover classifications before applying C-factor values from the literature. Van der Knijff et al.

      "content": "To address this, another method of determining the C factor is through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) estimated from satellite imagery. Although there are NDVI layers available, these are limited by geographical coverage, date of acquisition, and resolution. The MODIS NDVI dataset made by Caroll et al. (2004) at 250 m resolution covers the USA and South America². NASA produced a global dataset of NDVI values at 1º resolution for the time span of July 1983 to June 1984, making it suitable for studying historical soil erosion but not necessarily for the current state of land cover³.\n\nIn areas where ready-made NDVI products are unavailable, authors have used satellite imagery to obtain NDVI such as AVHRR or Landsat ETM (Van der Knijff et al., 2000; De Asis and Omosa, 2007; Ma et al., 2010, as cited in Li et al., 2014). De Asis and Omasa (2007) related the C factor and NDVI through fieldwork and image classification - determining the C factor at several points within the study area using the (R)USLE approach and relating it to the NDVI through regression correlation analysis. This may not be feasible in larger study areas such as the European Union, where Van der Knijff et al. (2000) determined NDVI from satellite imagery and created an equation based on its positive correlation with green vegetation (Table 7). This approach enabled them to create a C-factor map over the European Union. However, C factors were unrealistically high in some areas such as woodland and grassland, so values for those areas were taken from the literature.\n\nAn advantage of using NDVI is that researchers can determine sub-annual C factors if there is satellite imagery available, which can lead to understanding the contribution of cover to seasonal soil erosion and identifying critical periods within the year where soil erosion is a risk (Ferreira and Panagopoulos, 2014). Similar methods have been applied in Brazil by Durigon et al. (2014), Greece by Alexandridis et al. (2015), and Kyrgyzstan by Kulikov et al. (2016). Determining C factors at the seasonal scale is important because vegetation cover can change throughout the year due to agricultural and forestry practices."

Determining C factors at the seasonal scale is important because vegetation cover can change throughout the year due to agricultural and forestry practices. In study areas with a high temporal variation of rainfall throughout the year, seasonal vegetation can play a big part in exacerbating or mitigating soil erosion.\n\nTo summarise, the choice of which method to use depends on the scale of the study area, reported C factors for similar cover, and availability of high-resolution imagery. For small-scale studies, it is more feasible to determine the C factors through fieldwork. If previous (R)USLE studies have reported C factors for cover similar to the study area, those values can be used for the table-based approach. Lastly, high-resolution imagery can be used to determine the study area's\n\n2http://glcf.umd.edu/data/ndvi/ (last access: 12 November 2018)\n3https://data.giss.nasa.gov/landuse/ndvi.html (last access: 12 November 2018)\n\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/6059/2018/\n\nHydrol.

At small scales and with a good understanding of dif- ferences in land cover classifications, pulling values from the literature may be the most efficient choice, but at larger re- gional scales this may become tedious. At larger scales, high- resolution satellite imagery may be available to determine NDVI, but authors must be mindful of its acquisition date in relation to their study period, as well as data quality and im- age processing issues such as dealing with cloud cover and aggregating images from multiple satellite passes (Van der Knijff et al., 2000; Kulikov et al., 2016).\n\n2.5 Support practice factor (P)\n\nThe support practice factor (P) is defined as the ratio of soil loss under a specific soil conservation practice (e.g. contour- ing, terracing) to that of a field with upslope and downslope tillage (Renard et al., 1997). The P factor accounts for man- agement practices that affect soil erosion through modify- ing the flow pattern, such as contouring, strip cropping, or terracing (Renard et al., 1997). The more effective the con- servation practice is at mitigating soil erosion, the lower the P factor (Bagherzadeh, 2014).

The P factor can also be estimated using sub-factors, but the difficulty of accurately mapping support practice factors or not observing support practices leads to many studies ignoring it by giving their P factor a value of 1.0 as seen in Appendix A1 (Adornado et al., 2009; Renard et al., 1997; Schmitt, 2009).\n\nAnother possible reason why studies may ignore the P factor is due to the nature of their chosen C factors. Some C factors already account for the presence of a support factor such as intercropping or contouring. For example, Morgan (2005) and David (1988) give C factors for one type of crop, but with different types of management (Table 10). Despite the P factor being commonly ignored, a number of studies have reported possible P factors for different kinds of tillage, terracing, contouring, and strip cropping (Table 11). The P factor has a significant impact on the estimation of soil loss. For example, a P factor of 0.25 for zoned tillage reflects the potential for this management factor to reduce soil by 75% loss compared to conventional tillage (P factor: 1.00). At suitably detailed scales and with enough knowledge of farming practices, using these P factors may lead to a more accurate estimation of soil loss. Additionally, these P factors can be used in scenario analysis to understand how changing farming practices may mitigate or exacerbate soil loss. An application of (R)USLE in the Cagayan de Oro catchment in the Philippines showed, through scenario analysis, that soil conservation practices such as agroforestry and alley cropping could potentially lead to large decreases in soil loss compared to the baseline scenario (Benavidez, 2018).\n\nIn summary, including the P factor in (R)USLE applications is important because of the significant effects that some management practices can have on reducing soil loss compared to conventional tillage. The P factor is useful for studies where different management practices are being considered for the same site as it can elucidate which practices are more beneficial for soil conservation."

The original USLE was formulated based on soil erosion studies on agricultural land in the USA. When applied to different climate regimes and land cover conditions, this may lead to greater uncertainties associated with estimates of average annual soil loss (Kinnell, 2010). Since the (R)USLE parameters were developed based on small-scale studies of agricultural plots, there\nare also uncertainties associated with upscaling the original USLE to the catchment or regional scale (Nagle et al., 1999; Naipal et al., 2015). Wischmeier and Smith (1987) have also warned that using the (R)USLE in conditions extremely different from the agricultural conditions the model was formulated under may lead to extrapolation error. Of the studies reviewed for this paper (Table A1), most applications were done on catchments with predominantly agricultural land use, but under a range of different climatic conditions.\n\nSensitivity analysis and testing which (R)USLE sub-factors suit particular study sites is one method of addressing the (R)USLE's regional applicability. Like the Mangatarere application method in Sect. 2.1, other studies have tested multiple R-factor equations on the same dataset to determine which equation was most appropriate for their study site (Eiumnoh, 2000; Benavidez, 2018). Their derived R-factor values were compared to the values for catchments with similar climate and rainfall, or to maps of the R factor at larger spatial scales (Panagos et al., 2017). To reduce uncertainty in accounting for land use, work by Post and Hartcher (2005) recommended using C-factor values for specific land cover classifications (e.g."

      "content": "To reduce uncertainty in accounting for land use, work by Post and Hartcher (2005) recommended using C-factor values for specific land cover classifications (e.g. specific crops, forest growth stages) instead of values for broad land cover categories (e.g. agriculture, forest). Although C-factor values can be taken from the literature or determined in situ, an extensive literature review compiling potential soil loss rates of different crop and forest covers compared to likely soil loss rates of bare soil can be used to determine likely C-factor values of a particular site. Improvements and modifications to the (R)USLE sub-factors have made it applicable to larger spatial scales, including a coarse-resolution representation at the global scale (Naipal et al., 2015). The pan-European application by Panagos et al. (2015a) showed setting a maximum value for slope steepness of 50% (26.6°) would prevent significantly large LS-factor values and account for the absence of soil on such steep slopes. Assembling published estimates of (R)USLE sub-factors from different climatic regions and soil types would help in sensitivity testing (R)USLE equations, deciding the most appropriate equation to use, and verifying the derived (R)USLE sub-factor values.\n\nThe uncertainties associated with the (R)USLE, and arguably soil erosion modelling in general, stem from several factors: the inability of models to capture the complex interactions involved in soil loss, the low availability of long-term reliable data for modelling, and the lack of soil erosion observational data for model validation, especially in data-scarce environments. The simplicity of the (R)USLE allows usage in locations where there are insufficient data for more complex models that require large input datasets (de Vente and Poesen, 2005; Hernandez et al., 2012). Of the studies reviewed, very few critically discuss the uncertainties associated with the (R)USLE, but those that do offer several ways to overcome these uncertainties.\n\nSince the (R)USLE does not account for all the complex interactions associated with soil erosion, its predicted soil\n\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/6059/2018/\nHydrol.

Some applications have chosen to display their soil loss results as categorical to produce maps that show low, medium, or high areas of vulnerability instead of showing annual average amounts (Adornado et al., 2009; Schmitt, 2009). The (R)USLE is a good first attempt at identifying vulnerable areas and estimating soil loss for a landscape at the baseline scenario due to the model's relative simplicity and few data requirements (Aksoy and Kavvas, 2005). The (R)USLE is also useful for doing scenario analysis to check whether changing land use or management practices would either exacerbate or mitigate soil loss, making it useful for comparison purposes (Merritt et al., 2004; Nigel and Rughooputh, 2012).\n\nValidating the soil erosion rates produced by the (R)USLE is difficult because of the lack of easily obtainable observational soil erosion records, especially in data-scarce environments. Out of the (R)USLE applications reviewed for this paper, ~30% presented explicit comparisons between their modelled soil loss from (R)USLE and observed soil loss, modelled soil loss from (R)USLE and other models (one study), and soil loss from multiple models and observed soil loss (one study).\n\nOne study compared the soil loss rates predicted by the RUSLE to estimates of the physically based WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) model. Amore et al. (2004) compared RUSLE and WEPP and found that the ratio of modelled to observed soil loss of WEPP (0.7) was better than RUSLE (0.2) for the Trinità basin."

Another issue is differences in temporal and/or spatial resolution and sometimes differing timescales between modelled and observed estimates. Average observations based on occasional grab samples of sediment in streams may not well represent the monthly to annual sediment loads the (R)USLE is attempting to estimate. In another example, López-Vicente et al. (2008) compared observed to modelled values and had a ratio of modelled to observed soil loss of 0.62. However, the \"observed\" soil loss was based on 137Cs measurements that were indicative of average soil loss values for the past 40 years, while the model values were based on 1997–2006 driving data. During this period, the study area experienced lower precipitation and thus had lower modelled soil loss measurements compared to the soil loss derived from the 137Cs records (López-Vicente et al., 2008).\n\nAs stated earlier, the regional applicability of the RUSLE is a limitation that requires the sub-factors to be adjusted and modified based on the specific characteristics of the researcher's study site. Nakil and Khire (2016) and Abu Hammad et al. (2005) show this important practice in RUSLE applications in their studies. Through testing and refining their method of accounting for topography through the LS factor, the ratio of modelled to observed soil loss ranged from 0.8 to almost unity (Nakil and Khire, 2016). The initial application of RUSLE of Abu Hammad et al. (2005) over-estimated soil loss by a factor of 3, but with adjustments to the sub-factors based on local data on soil moisture, land cover, and support practices, the model error was reduced to 14%. The importance of adjusting RUSLE with the availability of more detailed data was further shown in the pan-European study of Panagos et al."

(2015e), where detailed soil, topography, land cover, and management practices allowed the researchers to refine their application where most of the ratios of modelled to observed soil loss were very good (0.9 to 1.3). In the validation areas where the soil loss comparisons were not good, further local testing and refining of the RUSLE sub-factors is seen as an area in which to improve the model results (Beskow et al., 2009; Ozsoy et al., 2012; Panagos et al., 2015e).\n\nA global soil erosion study using RUSLE was accomplished by Borrelli et al. (2017) using the rainfall erosivity map generated by Panagos et al. (2017) that showed comparable results to regional and local soil erosion estimates, and good agreement with global soil erosion datasets such as the Global Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) dataset4.\n\n<sup>4</sup>https://www.isric.online/projects/global-assessment-human-induced-soil-degradation-glasod (last access: 12 November 2018)\n\nFuture work in the soil erosion literature could include assembling a comprehensive database of global, regional, and national soil erosion rates to allow comparison between soil erosion modelling methods, not just (R)USLE results. A proxy for understanding soil erosion is water quality data such as total suspended solids (TSS) that includes sediment delivery and organic sources (Schmitt, 2009; Russo, 2015). However, TSS usually excludes the larger and heavier bed-load sediments that could be resulting from mass wasting events or erosion (Nagle et al., 1999). Nevertheless, water quality data are useful for inferring likely temporal patterns of soil erosion or the sediment yield during seasons of heavy rainfall or after extreme events. Ground truthing or analysis of satellite imagery is another useful method of validating the (R)USLE results, as the areas of extreme erosion risk can be checked for physical evidence of soil loss occurrence (De Asis and Omasa, 2007; Adornado and Yoshida, 2010; Nontananandh and Changnoi, 2012)."

By excluding these types of erosion, the (R)USLE may underestimate the actual soil loss (Thorne et al., 1985). The model also does not account for deposition, leading to overestimation, or sediment routing (Desmet and Govers, 1996; Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). Since it does not predict the sediment pathways from hill slopes to water bodies, it is difficult to analyse possible effects on downstream areas, such as pollution or sedimentation (Jahun et al., 2015). One of the possible methods for linking the (R)USLE results to sediment delivery to streams is using the sediment delivery ratio (SDR), defined as \"the ratio of the sediment delivered at a location in the stream system to the gross erosion from the drainage area above that point\" (Yoon et al., 2009). This parameter varies depending on the gradient, slope shape, and length and can also be influenced by land cover, roughness, etc. (Wu et al., 2005). Given that it is influenced by characteristics similar to those of the (R)USLE, future work can include not only combining the (R)USLE with the SDR to estimate sediment delivery to streams but also avoiding possible double counting. These two limitations of deposition and routing are linked to the model's representation of more topographically complex terrain, and previous studies have attempted to address them by improving on the LS factor by incorporating upstream contributing area (Desmet and Govers, 1996; Moore et al., 1991). A more detailed discussion of addressing these limitations is in Sect. 4.1."

Studies around the world continue to improve (R)USLE parameterisation and application in different climate regimes and locations.\n\n4 Future directions\n\nSince the (R)USLE and its family of models are used over different geographic locations and climate types, it is important for future research to build on them and improve their representation of real-world soil loss. Some of the future directions include incorporating soil loss from other types of erosion, estimating soil loss at seasonal or sub-annual temporal scales, and improving the consistency of formulae and units in the scientific literature.\n\n4.1 Representing other types of erosion\n\nAs previously discussed in Sect. 3, the (R)USLE does not account for all erosion types. This section mostly discusses possible extensions to include gully erosion, but further work to incorporate channel/bank erosion and mass wasting events must also be done.\n\nThe inability of (R)USLE to account for soil losses due to ephemeral gullies can lead to under-prediction of soil loss estimates (Thorne et al., 1985). These ephemeral gullies are small channels that form due to the erosive action of overland flow during a rainfall event (Momm et al., 2012). Gully erosion can contribute a significant amount of sediment loss; for example gully erosion is estimated to contribute between 30% and 50% of soil loss from a range of catchments in New Zealand (Basher et al., 2012). Desmet and Govers (1996) recommended that delineation of ephemeral gullies, such as through the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) developed by Thorne et al. (1985), combined with (R)USLE could improve the identification of vulnerable areas within a watershed. The CTI of Thorne et al. (1985) uses topographic analysis to predict locations and soil loss rates of ephemeral gullies based on upstream drainage area, slope, and the planform curvature. Hence, the combination of CTI and the (R)USLE is a promising direction for including gully erosion, but care must be taken in coupling these models because both already account for upstream drainage area and slope."

Simply adding their soil loss rates could lead to \"double counting\" and requires further research to determine the threshold values of CTI and LS factor over which ephemeral gullying is likely (Benavidez, 2018).\n\nWork along these lines, combining the effect of rill and sheet erosion with gully erosion was done by Momm et al. (2012) in Kansas and by Zakerinejad and Maeker (2015) in the Mazayjan watershed in Iran. Momm et al. (2012) combined several types of erosion – sheet and rill, gully, and bed and bank erosion – with the sheet and rill erosion estimated using the (R)USLE model. They used varying critical CTI thresholds to iteratively generate potential locations of ephemeral gullies and identify sub-watersheds prone to gully erosion, and then used scenario analysis to estimate reductions in sediment yields under conservation practices (Momm et al., 2012). One of the limitations of the Momm et al. (2012) study was that they only had a coarse-resolution DEM. Since ephemeral gullies are small features (typically a few metres wide and ~ 25 cm deep), higher-resolution DEMs such as those derived from lidar data would be better for analysis of these topographic features. The USPED, which is similar to the (R)USLE model, has also been used to estimate rill and sheet erosion rates with a stream power index (SPI) approach to estimate gully erosion rates (Zakerinejad and Maerker, 2015). Zakerinejad and Maerker (2015) estimated gully erosion in metric tons per hectare per year and combined it with the estimates from the USPED model to produce a map showing potential erosion and deposition within their study area. Hence, there are precedents as well as a need to combine erosion estimates from (R)USLE with a procedure that accounts for gully erosion for more effective land management."

As seen in the review of methods of calculating rainfall erosivity, many different studies have attempted to estimate the R factor, underscoring its importance to soil erosion research. However, estimating the R factor at the annual timescale does not account for seasonal variations in rainfall. It is useful for land management to understand seasonal variations in soil erosion vulnerability because of the dual effect of rainfall and land cover on soil loss, and the effect of rainfall on land cover (Kulikov et al., 2016). For example, when a season of heavy rainfall coincides with low vegetation cover, the risk of soil erosion increases considerably (Ferreira and Panagopoulos, 2014). Thus, most of the studies around seasonal estimations of soil loss revolve around changes in land cover and rainfall. The soil erodibility (K factor) can vary too due to changes in permeability and the effects of freezing and thawing, but it is less frequently studied compared to variations in land cover and rainfall (López-Vicente et al., 2008).\n\nStudies that incorporate seasonality in the (R)USLE commonly compute R factors and C factors at monthly or seasonal timescales. Lu and Yu (2002) computed monthly R factors in Australia, which were then used in a later study that computed C factors based on satellite imagery and the NDVI, to produce monthly maps of soil erosion vulnerability over the entire Australian continent (Lu et al., 2003; Lu and Yu, 2002). The method of estimating C factors using NDVI is popular due to the availability of remotely sensed imagery and the capability of processing datasets with relative expe-\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Other studies have used the NDVI and similar characteristics to estimate monthly and seasonal C factors in Brazil, Greece, and Kyrgyzstan (Alexandridis et al., 2015; Durigon et al., 2014; Ferreira and Panagopoulos, 2014; Kulikov et al., 2016; Panagos et al., 2012). The C factors can also be estimated monthly through the method recommended by (R)USLE, but this requires knowledge of prior land use, canopy cover, surface roughness, and soil moisture (López-Vicente et al., 2008).\n\nMonthly or seasonal estimations of rainfall factors are more useful to land management planning around crop growth cycles and tillage practices (Diodato, 2004). Studies have used different methods to calculate R factors, with data requirements ranging from per-storm basis to annual averages. To estimate monthly and seasonal estimations, the required rainfall data can be as fine as individual storm intensity to use the (R)USLE method or be as coarse as average monthly rainfall. Diodato (2004) in Italy and Kavian et al. (2011) used the (R)USLE method to calculate storm energy and summed these up per month and season to obtain R factors. Other studies have used daily and monthly rainfall to calculate monthly R factors and combine them for seasonal R factors (Alexandridis et al., 2015; Kavian et al., 2011; López-Vicente et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2003; Panagos et al., 2015d; Shamshad et al., 2008). The results of these studies focused on identifying high and low periods of the landscape's vulnerability to soil erosion, depending on combinations of rainfall intensity and land cover.\n\nTo summarise, modelling the sub-annual variations of soil erosion and sediment yield is important because of the many temporal and spatial variations in the factors that influence annual soil loss. These variations include seasonal rainfall variability, changes in the spatial distribution of erosion-prone areas over crop growth and tillage cycles, and potential seasonal changes in water quality due to changes in season-able distributions of extreme rainfall events."

      "content": "These variations include seasonal rainfall variability, changes in the spatial distribution of erosion-prone areas over crop growth and tillage cycles, and potential seasonal changes in water quality due to changes in season-able distributions of extreme rainfall events. Seasons with higher heavy rainfall will have a higher possibility of soil loss and mass wasting events, which in turn have a degrading effect on water quality and can cause destruction of infrastructure, putting communities and lives in danger. Over the crop growth and tillage cycles, the potential sediment yields to streams will change, and this has implications for land management and farmers who must abide by water quality standards. Modelling at the annual timescale is insufficient to capture these seasonal or monthly changes in potential soil loss, which are more important to land management planning, and thus underscores the utility of doing modelling at the sub-annual scale. These sub-annual model results can then be aggregated into an annual estimate of soil loss that would be more accurate compared to modelling using only annual averages of rainfall or land cover conditions.\n\n### 4.3 Consistency in units\n\nThe USLE was originally developed using imperial units; although the handbook provides conversion factors to convert to metric, there are still issues within the scientific literature regarding units. In the process of this review, it was noted that, although most studies used the metric units for R factor and K factor, there were other studies that did not report their units or had units that were not the imperial or metric units of (R)USLE. Since the original (R)USLE was formulated with US customary units, researchers must be careful to use the correct units and conversions to metric (Renard and Freimund, 1994). To convert from imperial to metric units, Renard et al. (1997) recommends a conversion factor of 17.02 for the R factor and 0.1317 for the K factor. As mentioned in Sect. 3, there are uncertainties associated with the (R)USLE, and publishing sub-factor values and soil loss estimates for future reference by other researchers is a potential way of reducing some of those uncertainties. The problem of unclear or inconsistent units causes problems for future researchers in terms of adapting the rainfall erosivity or soil erodibility equations for their own study sites, underscoring the need for clear and explicit reporting of units in the (R)USLE literature."

However, this review shows the difficulty in finding the most appropriate method of calculating its sub-factors depending on location, availability of data, and previous studies done in nearby or similar regions. This paper reviewed the different components of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its updated form, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Different studies around the world were collected and analysed to compile how they adapted (R)USLE to their unique conditions, how they had estimated the (R)USLE sub-factors with limited data availability, and how these methods have been used by subsequent soil erosion studies. At the end of each sub-factor section, a brief summary is given outlining which datasets and equations would be useful for new users depending on their location and data availability. Each sub-factor section clarifies some of the assumptions and limitations associated with the original (R)USLE models and how users can overcome some of the uncertainties associated with these sub-factors. One common theme in the sub-factor reviews is that sensitivity testing of the sub-factors should be done by future (R)USLE applications by trialling several equations for one sub-factor before using it in the final soil erosion estimates.\n\nThis paper also presented the limitations of the (R)USLE, mainly the uncertainties associated with the simple empirical model, uncertainties with data availability and validation,\n\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/6059/2018/\nHydrol.

Benavidez et al.: A review of the (Revised) Universal Soil Loss Equation ((R)USLE)\n\nand the model's inability to account for types of soil erosion other than rill or inter-rill erosion. Lastly, the paper outlined some key future directions for (R)USLE research: incorporating soil loss from other types of soil erosion, importance of estimating soil loss at sub-annual scales and recommended equations, validation of soil loss estimates, and consistency in reporting units in the future literature. To represent gully erosion, the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) was briefly discussed, while the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) was also presented to account for linking soil loss to sediment delivery to streams. The ability to predict sub-annual soil loss or seasonal erosion modelling is important in study areas having high temporal variation of rainfall throughout the year, and/or having varying crop growth and tillage cycles, both being factors that can impact potential soil loss. Land management policy and decisions might be more robust if they consider modelling scenarios that test the effect of different types of crop and support practices on soil erosion mitigation. These scenarios can include a myriad of options: expanded urban areas or development, changing crop rotation cycles, or applying support practices in steep or upland areas. Further, seasonal soil erosion has implications on water quality, and understanding the extent of the problem can help local government address potential sources of sediment delivery and be more proactive in land management. Validation of soil loss estimates is important in understanding the accuracy of the (R)USLE application, and future work could involve compiling an extensive global database of soil loss estimates derived from observations and models, including those models more complex than (R)USLE. This database would be useful for future researchers in comparing their results and assess the accuracy of model applications. Greater transparency in reporting the sub-factor units, sub-factor values, and soil loss estimates is important to decrease uncertainty when future (R)USLE applications borrow sub-factor equations and values from previous studies. The limitations section addresses the fourth objective of this review.\n\nIn conclusion, the choices made regarding applications of the (R)USLE depend on the kind of data that are available for a study area and how they can adapt or change information from other studies to suit their area's particular climate, soil type, topography, typical land cover, and support practices.\n\nData availability."

Assessing the soil erosion quantitatively and spatially provides information to prioritize the soil conservation area\nin sustainable land management view point. Among the other soil erosion approaches, erosion modeling has been playing a\nsignificant role and provides an accurate result in a cost-effective manner. In this study, revised universal soil loss equation\n(RUSLE) was integrated with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) to analyse the quantitative and\nspatial distribution of soil erosion across the entire Kotmale watershed which is located in the western part of the central\nmountain region in Sri Lanka. In the methodology, the parameters of the RUSLE model were estimated using pixel overlay\nmethod in ArcGIS software, both spatial data and remote sensing data facilitated with appropriate calibration. From the\nanalysis, the annual soil erosion ranges from 0 to 472 t ha-¹ year-¹ with the mean and standard deviation 9.8 t ha¯¹ year-1\nand 15.7 t ha¹ year¹ respectively. The mean erosion rate of the model was correlated with ground based data. After the\nfinal model was established, conservation priority area was identified by using hot and cold spot analysis. Here \"hot spots\"\nshows the area with high soil erosion clustering value, while \"cold spot\" refers to area with low soil erosion clustering. The\nsoil conservation priority map has been produced and the result shows that approximately 25% represents hot sport. The\nresult would be an aid and sources for soil and water conservation in the Kotmale watershed."

Introduction\n\nThe erosion phenomenon consists in the detachments of\nindividual soil particles from the soil mass which are trans-\nported by erosive agents such as water and wind (FAO\n2015). It moves the soil particles of the most upper layer of\nthe ground from one plot to another plot. Further, soil ero-\nsion is a complex and progressive phenomenon that has been\nincreasing around the twentieth century all over the world\n(Singh and Panda 2017). It is estimated that 75 billion metric\ntons of soil is removed by wind and water in annually (Diya-\nbalanage et al. 2017). Moreover, FAO stated that global soil\nerosion by water is 20–30 Gt (gigatons) year¹ (FAO 2015).\nIn addition to that, two billion hectares had been eroded by\nhuman intervention in globally. By this, water erosion has\ncontributed to 1100 million hectares (Ganasri and Ramesh\n2016).

Accelerated water erosion has become a leading soil degradation scenario in the tropical region because of the human activities (Diyabalanage et al. 2017).Hence, global soil erosion by water has reached an alarming level and it should be addressed sustainably.\n\nField survey based conventional soil erosion assessment methods are not cost effective and time-consuming task. Thus, several erosion models have been developed, and they can be categorized into three groups such as empirical, conceptual and physical (Devatha et al. 2015). Each model has its own attributes and application scope with the data that has been used to run the model (Ricker et al. 2008; Rahman et al. 2009; Wijesundara et al. 2018). Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is an empirical soil erosion model which was formulated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1978 to conjecture amount of soil loss in long-term basis (Abdo and Salloum 2017). Furthermore, it focuses on inter-rill and rill erosion from cropland by water with the effects of some attributes of geology, climatology and topographical features. USLE was updated as The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) (Renard et al. 1997). RUSLE was originally developed to assess soil erosion of gently sloping agricultural land (Wischmeier and Smith 1978). Hence, in recent years many researchers across the world adopted RUSLE. Some of them aligned to the watershed to compute the magnitude of the soil erosion associated with agricultural activities (Prasannakumar et al. 2012).\n\nThe clustering pattern of soil erosion provide the clear picture to undestand the conservation priority area. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic is commonly used tool for understand the clustering pattern. The hot and cold spot analysis has been used by several field of studies, including disaster management (Gajovic and Todorovic 2013), urbanization (Rodriguez Lopez et al. 2017), land cover influence (Li et al. 2016), ecology (Wasowicz 2014) and green volume estimation (Handayani et al. 2018)."

The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from 1:50,000 data (Sources - Department of Survey in Sri Lanka) illustrates an elevation ranges from 681 m to 2505 m above mean sea level and slopes ranging from 0° to 72°. The general slope of the terrain is towards Northeast of the watershed. Regarding hydro-climatological status, the watershed area is located in a tropical climate region, characterized by heavy rainfall and relatively constant, high temperature and humidity. The Kotmale watershed experiences according to the monsoon distribution of the rainfall. The greatest rainfall is reported during the Southwest monsoon (May to September). Annual rainfall over the Kotmale watershed area is approximately 1800-2500 mm but may be fluctuated due to the seasonal variation and climate changes (Johansson 1989). The Kotmale river (Kotmale Oya) is the longest tributary and headwaters of the Mahaweli river which is the fourth longest river in Sri Lanka. The river originates as the Agra river (Agra Oya) in the Hatten plateau itself, and the total length is approximately 70 km (Johansson 1989). The hydro-climatological features have made the area very liable to heavy soil erosion.\n\nAs an ecological perspective, mountain forest distributes upper part of the catchment area, and less dense forest patches are dispersed across the watershed. The watershed contains a rich biodiversity which including several flora and fauna organisms. There have been taken place many biophysical and socio-economical changes in the Kotmale watershed associated with soil erosion (Johansson 1989). Land degradation, siltation, loss of soil fertility and loss of natural habitats are highlighted among them. Despite of several research opportunities which are enabled by RUSLE,"

Hence, many scholars have used RUSLE model with GIS and RS for the various kinds of research and deci-sion making purposes (Ozsoy et al. 2012; Balasubramani et al. 2015; Biswas and Pani 2015; Fenta et al. 2016). In the application of RUSLE model on GIS and RS environment, soil loss is estimated by using raster analysis.

      "content": "Derivation of R factor from rainfall data\n\nThe rainfall erosivity factor (mm ha¯¹ h-1 year-¹) reflects the detachment of soil at a location by raindrop splash ero-sion. The product of rainfall kinetic energy (E) and the maxi-mum 30 min rainfall intensity (130) continuous precipitation data are required to calculate the R factor (Wischmeier and Smith 1978; Ganasri and Ramesh 2016), but it is very dif-ficult to gather the rain gauging based records of rainfall intensity for long periods in research area due to malfunction of data collection procedure. Hence, many scholars have pro-posed more mature and simple calculation methods of rain-fall erosivity based on monthly and annual rainfall (Marco 2004; Dutta et al. 2015). This calculation method can be effortlessly incorporated with RS and GIS through the inter-polation technique. There are several kinds of interpolation technique in GIS environment. Among them, Inverse Dis-tance Weighted (IDW) is widely used computation of spa-tial data due to simplicity and high accuracy (Ozsoy et al. 2012; Gunaalan et al. 2018). R factor was computed by using\n\nModeling Earth Systems and Environment\n\nmonthly rainfall data which was published by the Depart-ment of Meteorology in Sri Lanka in 2016. In this computa-tion process, 26 rain gauging stations which are located not only within the watershed but also 5 km buffer bordering range have been considering for maintaining high accuracy of the result (Ganasri and Ramesh 2016). A number of for-mulas have been developed to compute the R factor, among them the Eq. 3 was used to compute the R factor which is developed by Premalal 1986 (Wijesekara and Samarakoon 2001), especially for Sri Lanka.\n\nR = 972.75 + (9.95 x P) / 100 (3)\n\nwhere, R is a rainfall erosivity factor, P is the mean annual rainfall in mm.\n\nDerivation of K factor from soil attributes\n\nSoil erodibility (K) factor represents both susceptibility of soil to erosion and the rate of runoff, as measured under the standard unit plot condition (Ganasri and Ramesh 2016)."

Hence, each attribute of the soil types are determined by second-ary data sources which were published by the Soil Science Society of Sri Lanka in 1999 (Mapa et al. 1999). As a next step, nomography is used to compute the value of K based on its properties such as texture, organic matter, structure and permeability (Wischmeier and Smith 1978; Ganasri and Ramesh 2016).\n\nDerivation of LS factor from topography\n\nThe effect of the topography is playing the wider role in the soil erosion process. Thus, RUSLE model accounts it by the LS factors which combine the effect of a slope length factor (L) and slope steepness factor (S). The L factor represents the effect of slope length on erosion and it is defined as the distance from the origin of overland flow along its flow path to the location of either concentrated flow to the channel or deposition. When L factor increases, total soil erosion and soil erosion per unit area is increased by progressive accumulation of runoff in the downslope direction. S factor represents the effect of slope steepness on erosion. Soil loss and its veloc-ity increases more rapidly with slope steepness than it does with slope length (Prasannakumar et al. 2011). The GIS and RS technology have enabled more precise estimation of LS factor through the raster calculation process by using DEM. Equation 4 illustrates LS factor computation method employed in this study. A number of similar studies have adopted this"

In this study, the slope gradient was 3.1%. Hence, 0.3 was taken as a value of y. Sg is the angle of the slope.\n\n30 m spatial resolution DEM was used as a primary data source to compute the LS by using Arc GIS 10.4. After conducting fill and flow direction process, flow accumulation was calculated with Arc hydrology tool in order to formulate the L factor. In the same way, the slope was derived from the DEM with the same resolution. Then, S factor was computed by using the slope data. Finally, LS factor was calculated in Arc GIS raster calculation using the map algebra expression in Eq. 4 (Gelagay and Minale 2016).\n\n### Derivation of C factor from vegetation cover\n\nCover and management factor is the subsequent significant factor next to the topographic factor. It is defined as the ratio of soil loss from land cropped under specific conditions to the corresponding loss from clean-tilled, continuous fallow (Wischmeier and Smith 1978). Detachment of soil is very sensitive to vegetation/land cover with slope steepness and slope length factor. Vegetation cover and canopy behaves as a blanket in order to dissipate the raindrop energy before reaching the bare soil surface (Prasannakumar et al. 2011).

Its value is various from − 1 to + 1 range donoting − 1 as a non-vegetation and + 1 as a high-dense vegetation (Ranagalage et al. 2017, 2018b). Similarly, C factor value also ranges between 0 to + 1. Hence, many researchers use this principle to estimate C factor from NDVI (Alexakis et al. 2013; Dutta 2016; Abdo and Salloum 2017). Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images (path: 141, row: 55) acquisition date on 2016.03.15 were exploited to assess the NDVI value. Then, NDVI values were scaled to approximate C values using the following provisional Eq. 5\n\nC = exp [-α NDVI / (β- NDVI)] (5)\n\nwhere, a = 1 and ẞ=2 (Alexakis et al. 2013). In many studies have been used this values to compute C factor and found that this scaling approach gave better result (Prasannakumar et al. 2011; Shit et al. 2015) NDVI is Near Infrared (NIR)-Red (R)/Near Infrared (NIR) + Red (R).\n\n### Derivation of P factor from land use/land cover\n\nErosion control practice factor is the ratio of soil loss with a specific support practice to the corresponding loss with up slope and down slope cultivation (Wischmeier and Smith 1978). By considering lack of updated land use and land cover information in the study area, the current land use digital data layer (Sources: Department of Survey in Sri Lanka, 2011) has been updated by using remote sensing data (reference with google earth image). Using this method ten land use types were updated, and field observation data were used to validate the updated land use types (Ranagalage et al. 2018c). Identification of different agricultural land use pattern was one of the objective of this land use updating process. It was difficult to distinguish between each agricultural land use types by using classification (pixel-based or object-oriented) due to the similar spectral signature."

The value of the mean annual rainfall was 1564 mm, and the standard deviation was 317 mm in the year of 2016. Spatial variation of the rainfall illustrates in (Fig. 2a) with respective rain gauging stations. The Western part of the watershed was obtained higher rainfall than the other area because Southwest monsoon (May to September) is the main rain sources of the Kotmale watershed which was explained in details under the study area. A continuous surface was developed from the point data of the 26 rain gauging stations. The estimated R factor value ranges from 50 to 244 mm ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, and standard deviation was 33.9 mm ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ and mean was 153.6 mm\n\n<br>\n\n|                       |               |\n| :-------------------- | :------------ |\n| Annual rainfall (mm)  |               |\n| < 500                 |               |\n| 500 - 1,000           |               |\n| 1,000 - 1,500         |               |\n| 1,500 - 2,000         |               |\n| >2,000                |               |\n\n|                               |               |\n| :---------------------------- | :------------ |\n| Rainfall gauging sations      |               |\n| Buffer (5km)                  |               |\n| Kotmale Catchment             |               |\n\n|               |               |\n| :------------ | :------------ |\n| R factor (mm) | No Data (Water body) |\n| High : 244    |               |\n| Low : 50      |               |\n\n<br>\n\nFig. 2 a Spatial distribution of the rainfall with corresponding rain gauging stations in the Kotmale watershed; b R factor of the Kotmale watershed\n\nSpringer"

High R factor value shows that the area where the highest rainfall was accumulated (Fig. 3b).\n\n# Soil erodibility factor\n\nThree dissimilar soil types are comprised in the Kotmale watershed which expressions in (Fig. 3a). Among them, 51% belongs to Red-Yellow Podzolic with hilly and rolling terrain category, and 40% and 9% is denoted by Red-Yellow Podzolic with mountainous terrain and Red-Yellow Podzolic with dark B horizon, respectively. K values are assigned to each soil by considering soil attribute of them. Though there are three soil types, two of them are expressed the most similar classes (Mapa et al. 1999). Hence, these two soil types are denoted with same K value (0.18) and represent the less K value with high permeability rate compared with other soil type. The higher value of K (0.21) belongs to Red-Yellow Podzolic with dark B horizon, and it represents moderate permeability rate which susceptibility to the detachment (Fonseca et al. 2017).\n\n# Slope length and steepness factor\n\nThe slope of the study area varies from 0° to 72°, with a mean and standard deviation of 13° and 8° correspondingly. The areas where acquired by the water bodies and other few polders denote the 0°, and most of area belongs to high slope area. As a comparison, most of the hilly areas shows in the northern portion of the watershed than the others, middle and lower slope areas disperse the watershed as shown in (Fig. 4a).\n\nThe lower part of the watershed area represents high accumulation (slope length) as a result of the contribution of upstream. The upper part of the watershed area denotes opposite of this principle due to the low contribution of river branches in headwater to the total accumulation (Gelagay and Minale 2016) as shown in (Fig. 4b). Slope steepness (S factor) shown in (Fig. 4c) revealed that the higher value in the high slope area and lower value of the lower elevation area specially polder. With the above explanation, slope length and slope steepness are homogeneously contributed."

The dense forest has distributed along the boundary of South and West part of the watershed as a bounded band and denotes 30.5% out of the total land property. In this study, the P factor values were computed by evaluating land use information. The value of P factor ranges from 0 to 0.75, highest value observed the area where no conservation methods adopted and lower values observed the area that associated with higher conservation practices as shown in (Fig. 6b).\n\n### Spatial distributions of annual soil erosion\n\nThe spatial distribution of annual soil erosion was produced by overlaying the five factors of RUSLE using the raster calculator with Eq. 2. According to the result of the analysis, the annual soil erosion ranges from 0 to 472 t ha¯¹ year-1 with the mean and standard deviation 9.8 t ha¯¹ year-¹ and 15.7 t ha 1 year ¹ correspondingly.\n\nFor the visual interpretation and easy understanding, the ranges values have been breakdown into the class by using appropriate interval. Earlier similar studies related to the RUSLE and soil erosion based on GIS have been used several approaches to define classes interval for the zone of the potential annual soil erosion to emphasize the real situation (Prasannakumar et al. 2011; Aiello et al. 2015). In this study, classes interval of the severity was defined by using a natural break and examining the past research that has been taken place on similar methodology (Ostovari et al. 2017). This approach have been led to assign five soil erosion severity such as very low (<10 t ha¯¹ year-¹), low (from 10 t ha¯¹ year-¹ to 30 t ha¯¹ year-¹), moderate (from 30 t ha¹ year-1 to 60 t ha-1 year ¹), severe (from 60 t ha-1 year 1 to 100 t ha¹ year¹) and very severe (> 100 t ha¹ year¯¹).

However, two methods have been adopted based on secondary data sources to validate the results of the current study. (1) First method is cross- check with similar catchment which is available ground level data and, (2) Second method is to validate with the literature information and result of the past research. \"Uma Oya\" catchment is one of the sub catchment located in UMCA and bio-physical characteristics are most similar to the Kotmale catchment (Diyabalanage et al. 2017).\n\nAnnual sediment yield of the Uma Oya has been measured by the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka from 1992 to 2012 (Environment and forest conservation division 2017) and result has been plotted into (Fig. 9) but 2005-2008 data was not recoded. Further, Average sediment yield of the whole period (from 1992 to 2012) was 10.45 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. The result of the RUSLE was 9.8 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ which was applied to the Kotmale catchment. Difference between these two is 0.65 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. With this result it can be realized that, there isn't significant different between observed and predicated value."

By experience with them, the mean erosion rate of the present study has been correlated with the result of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations annual report in 2015 (FAO 2015). Moreover, it's stated that average soil erosion by water in the tropical area is often < 10 t ha-1 year⁻¹. In this study, the average soil erosion is observed as 9.8 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. In addition to that, Result of the National Action Program (NAP) for combating land degradation in Sri Lanka 2015-2024 is most similar with the result of this analysis (Lanka 2015). NAP reveled that mean soil ero- sion of the upcountry wet zone approximately 10-13 tha-1 year⁻¹ in this study it was 9.8 t ha-1 year 1. Moreover, the suspended load in the Mahaweli River was first measured near the Botanic Gardens, Peradeniya in Kandy and result shows that annual maximum rate of sediment yield of 11.5 tha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (Hewawasam 2010). Further, (Table 4) shows the summary of the past research which are used literature information to validate the result of the soil erosion model.\n\nFig."

      "content": "(1) The highest value of the soil erosion (472 t ha¹ year¯¹) is observed in severe soil erosion category and, (2) Mean erosion rate is 140.39 t ha-1 year-1 in this region. In addition to that, the high mean value of the LS factor in (Table 2) provides evidence that the severe erosion zones are spatially distributed across narrow, steep slope part of the watershed. Further, highest values of C factor indicate that less vegetation cover which would be cause for the poor resistant to erosion. High values of the P factor designate that there is lack of conservation practices and high R factor also indicates that probability to high erosion. It is an obvious fact that this zone (severs and very severs) less impervious to the rill and inter-rill erosion. The Gi* value of the hot spot analysis is actually a Z score; the largest Z scores computed that clustering of high values which are generated by the RUSLE. It can be grouping the value of the severe and very severe areas in order to spatially visualize of soil erosion. This scenario can be clearly observed with Fig. 8 than the Fig. 7. Soil as spatially distributed components, identification of its erosion in spatially is more useful for decision making process. Furthermore, hot and cold spot analysis also provides the detailed information related to finding the conservation priority areas, planners need to consider the hot spot area to introduce soil conservation method. Nearly 20% of the watershed has under to hot spot. Hence, key conservation practices and appropriate management strategies are required for this region to conserve the soil sustainably as a priority area.\n\nThe moderate class represents 5.5% out of the total area and spatially disperses along the moderate slope area excepting dense forest area. Mean value of the C and P factor of this regain denotes naturally vulnerability to the soil erosion. As a result of these factors, mean erosion rate of the moderate class is observed as 40.61 tha¹ year ¹. Attention should be paid to non-significant area to prevent them from becoming hotspot near future. Past research have revealed that non-significant spots have more chance to convert to hot spots than cold shots (Ranagalage et al. 2018a). Thus, it is needed to make an erosion conservation practices for this region as a second priority task."

This region represents high resistant to the rill and inter-rill erosion because of high vegetation cover (low C factor) and appropriate conservation practices also admitted in this zone (less P factor). As same, other three factors cooperatively lead to the less erosion in this zone. Hence, this zone is under the tolerable soil erosion level and will require erosion control only if the level increases as a consequence of changes in the attributes of anthropogenic or bio-physical factors.\n\n## Agricultural land vulnerability and human intervention\n\nIn a broad perspective, the factors of the RUSLE model can be categorized into two parts such as physical and\n\nSpringer"

With these information, it is emphasized that nature (natural environment) is the driving forces of the R, K and LS factors not in a human being. Hence, these factors can be categorized as physical factors. C factor is the cover and management factor, and P factor is the support practice factor that have been taken place by nature or human being to preserve the soil erosion. Thus, C and P factor are the most important to discuss the human intervention to the soil erosion in the perspective of agricultural land vulnerability because of these two factors can increase or decrease as a result of the anthropogenic activities, especially agricultural activities, and other unplanned land use practices.\n\nLand use map (Fig. 6a) has been overlaid with the soil erosion zone map (Fig. 7) by using zonal statistic methods in Arc GIS and values were extracted. Then, the extracted values have been statistically potted into the (Table 5) to access the human intervention to the soil erosion. It shows the mean soil erosion with corresponding land use and con- tribution of each land use types as a percentage of each soil erosion severity zone.\n\nAccording to the statistical information of the annual report of the Sri Lanka labor force survey in 2016 (Depart- ment of Census and Statistics 2016), 66.1% labor force has contributed to the commercial or non-commercial agri- cultural activities in the research area. Hence, pressure and competition to the land resources is high. Tea cultiva- tion has been established as main commercial agricultural activity in the watershed with occupying 39.1% from the total area (Table 5). Mean erosion rate of the tea land is observed as 11.9 t ha¹ year-¹. This information indicates that contribution of the human intervention to the soil ero- sion because tea is not a natural vegetation and belongs to unnatural vegetation grown by people. By the information of the annual report of the Sri Lanka labor force survey in 2016 (Department of Census and Statistics 2016) and other information gathered through the field survey, vegetable cultivation is important agricultural activity next to the tea cultivation."

      "content": "By the information of the annual report of the Sri Lanka labor force survey in 2016 (Department of Census and Statistics 2016) and other information gathered through the field survey, vegetable cultivation is important agricultural activity next to the tea cultivation. There is high demand for the upland (upcoun- try) vegetable in Sri Lanka (The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka 2012; Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016) and it is pri- mary income source for the farmers who are not engaging in tea cultivation and secondary income source of the farmers who have to engage in tea cultivation. Mainly, scrub land, and chena land have been occupied as a vegetable cropland due to the insufficient land resources for the cultivation and high demand for the upcountry vegetable (Johansson 1989). Table 5 shows that, highest mean soil erosion rate (35.9 t ha¯¹ year-¹) is denoted by scrub land and more than 44% of the scrub lands are categorized into above the moderate soil erosion zone. Similarly, more than 42% of the chena land also represents the same soil erosion classes and the second highest mean soil erosion 27.4 t ha¯¹ year-¹ is observed by the chena land. Thus, usage of these land for further agri- cultural activities without applying appropriate remedial and conservation methods will cause the vulnerable agricultural land and food security due to soil erosion.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study impels that, GIS and RS have certain capability to integrate RUSLE empirical soil erosion models to predict soil loss quantitatively and spatially and compute the soil probability zone with erosion priority area where alarming indicates to expose the high soil erosion. Moreover, the study reveals that while the estimated highest annual soil loss rate was 472 t ha¹ year-¹, the mean and standard deviation was 9.8 t ha 1 year 1 and 15.7 t ha-¹ year-¹ respectively in the Kotmale watershed area.\n\nErosion probability map shows that severe zones were exposed mainly in high slope area and the agricultural area including chena lands and scrub land where located in the moderate slope area. Soil erosion of the agricultural area (commercial and non-commercial) is relatively higher than the natural vegetation, which implies the role of various anthropogenic attributes on simulated soil erosion."

The combination of intensive farming activities, improper farming practices, rainfall regimes, and topography conditions that taken place in agricultural land lead to the soil erosion problem. Soil erosion is the major constraint to agriculture that affects the yield production and degraded environmental sustainability. Furthermore, soil erosion that occurs in the agricultural area has jeopardized the sustainability of agriculture activities. Asia is one of the major agricultural producers in the world. It is essential to know how to mitigate soil erosion in Asian agri- cultural land. This systematic review aims to analyze the existing literature on research that has been done on control practices that had been taken in Asia agricultural land towards soil erosion. This article is guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) review method. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to study the control practices that been taken and tested to control soil erosion on the agricultural land in Asia. Accordingly, this systematic review identified 39 related studies about the topic based on the Web of Science and Scopus databases. This article divided the control practices into three main themes, which are agronomic practices, agro- stological practices, and mechanical practices. The three main themes then produced a total of 11 sub- themes. Further specific and sustained research is needed to tackle this severe environmental problem through a better method, such as this systematic review method."

Future direction and conclusion 113\nReferences 113\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nLand is very precious and plays an essential role in every living thing in this world. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (17 goals) is one of the ways proposed by the United Nations in 2015 to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. An increase in pressure on land is highly likely to happen to achieve the SDGs that related to food, health, water, and climate (Keesstra et al., 2018). The current demographic trends and projected growth in the global population (to exceed nine billion by 2050) are estimated to result in a 60% increase in demand for food, feed, and fiber (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2015). In order to fulfill the desire to have a sustainable generation in term of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, land need to be explored to satisfy all these needs through agriculture and development. By exploring the land has created land degradation problems. Therefore, there is an urgent need to stop land degradation and establish frameworks for sustainable land systems (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2015). SDG 15.3 is specifically focused on land degradation neutrality. Soil is an important part of the land, and land degradation means will be affecting the soil systems that link to other systems such as the water system. Thus, to comply with the related SDGs, soil act as a critical element and need special attention. Soil science is one of the land-related disciplines and has an essential linked with several SDGs (Keesstra et al., 2016). One of the land degradation issues related to the soil that has attract different stakeholder attention is soil erosion.\n\nSoil erosion is a global problem and rise as one of the major issues in many countries. Soil erosion generally means the destruction of soil by the action of natural phenomena (e.g., water, wind, and snow) and human-made factors (e.g., intensive and extensive agriculture) operating in conjunction (Zachar, 1982)."

      "content": "According to Holy (1980), erosion can be classified as a natural or an accelerated process, depending on its intensity. In the first category, soil erosion occurs under normal conditions that take place for million years and is the means for the formation of new soils. While accelerated soil erosion is a result of human activities mostly through deforestation, overgrazing, and non-suitable farming practices where soil loss is much more than its formation. Soil erosion has negative impacts on agricultural production, quality of source water, and ecosystem health in terms of aquatic and land environment (Fayas, Abeysingha, Nirmanee, Samaratunga, & Mallawatantri, 2019). Few factors lead to soil erosion, which are soil erodibility, climate erosivity, terrain, and ground cover.\n\nSoil is the basis of production in agriculture. Soil erosion that occurs in the agricultural area has jeopardized the sustainability of agriculture activities. Accelerated soil erosion has unfavorable environmental and economic impacts (Lal, 1998). Productivity effects of soil erosion are likely occurred both on-site and off-site. The on-site and off-site productivity loss due to soil erosion is attributed to three interacting effects, which are a reduction in soil quality, long-term productivity effects, short-term productivity effects (Lal, 2001). In the agricultural land, the detachment and segregation of particles from the soil mass happen when rain splashes hit the soil surface that already loose because of the improper agriculture practices such as intensive tillage. The soil particles could be thrown through the air over distances of several centimeters when the raindrops strike the soil surface (Morgan, 2005) and continuous exposure to heavy rainfall considerably weakens the soil. Many experimental studies have been conducted that show the influence of cropping on erosion rates (Nearing, Xie, Liu, & Ye, 2017). One of the effects of soil erosion is the denudation of topsoil and reduction of soil fertility which makes the land involves unfavorable for agriculture and will impact the production of yield in agricultural land. Apart from that, the fine materials of the eroded sediment, which will ultimately reach surface-water bodies will also create problems such as high sedimentation that then lead to flooding. If pesticides or fertilizers are contained in the eroded material, degradation of downstream water quality or ingestion of these contaminants by aquatic organisms is also likely to occur."

      "content": "If pesticides or fertilizers are contained in the eroded material, degradation of downstream water quality or ingestion of these contaminants by aquatic organisms is also likely to occur.\n\nAsia produces 90% of the world's total supply of rice and produces a variety of subtropical and tropical fruit, primarily for local consumption (Narasimhan et al., 2019). Other than that, Asia also noted for several plantations of important cash crops such as tea, palm oil, coconut, sugarcane, and rubber. Unfortunately, despite generating good income for Asia, agriculture activities bring a negative impact on the environment, which is soil erosion. Asia probably has suffered more from soil erosion than any other continent. The total area that affected by soil erosion in Asia is 663 Mha (Lal, 2001), and this is considered higher compared to other continents. Borrelli et al. (2017), listed several soil erosion hot-spots that the erosion rates are higher than 20 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. The largest and most intensively eroded regions are predicted in few countries, and Asian countries are included. The Asian countries are China (0.47 million km2; 6.3% of the country), India (0.20 million km²; 7.5% of the country) and Indonesia (0.076 million km²; 5% of the country). Soil erosion has been a major environmental issue in China (Guo, Hao, & Liu, 2015). According to them, the regional differences in the soil loss rate in China were mainly observed on fallow land and farmland, however almost no differences were observed on forest, shrub, and grasslands. In the northwest and southwest China, the soil loss rates of farmland with conventional tillage were much higher than in most other countries (Guo et al., 2015). In India, the land degradation caused by erosion happened because of inappropriate agricultural practices and has a direct and adverse effect on the food and livelihood security of farmers (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016). According to Sumiahadi and Acar (2019), agricultural land is a major area with the highest soil erosion rate in Indonesia, and it is because of inappropriate agricultural practices such as agriculture activities on very steep slopes (more than 15%) and cultivation in a sloping area without any protective measures."

Controlling soil erosion is a matter of encouraging innovative approaches in land management techniques and methods. Lots of research had been done on control practices of soil erosion in terms of management every year in Asia. Studies mostly focus on the effect of different management practices, such as tillage operation (L.

Those studies also apply various kinds of practices, such as using straw mulch (Keesstra et al., 2019) and using catch crop (Cerdà, Rodrigo-Comino, Giménez-Morera, & Keesstra, 2018). Researchers in the related field has always come out with studies on how to deal with soil erosion problems and turned out with many findings that are sometimes conflicting. These happen may due to study differences, flaws, or chance (sampling variation). Therefore, it is not clear about the real situation, or the most reliable results should be used and practiced. Thus, a systematic review is needed to identify research that been done.\n\nA systematic review is a review of clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that included in the review. Statistical methods may or may not be used to analyze and summarize the results of the included studies (Higgins et al., 2011). To construct a relevant systematic review, this article was guided by the main research question - what are the soil erosion control practices that been tested the suitability of the practices in Asia agricultural land. The objectives of this article are to identifies and characterizes the soil erosion control practices research in the Asian agricultural areas. This article also aims to see how far the existing research has been conducted to control soil erosion and the most widely used method for controlling soil erosion. This article primarily focuses on the practices to control soil erosion in the agricultural area that is affected by topography, rainfall, and intensive agriculture activities. This study will only review soil erosion control practices on field level practice that will cover 11 subthemes as listed in the result.\n\n2.  Methodology\n\nThe method used to retrieve articles related to control soil erosion practices in Asia agricultural land was discussed in this section. A method called PRISMA was used to do this systematic literature review that includes resources, eligibility and exclusion criteria, the systematic review process, and data abstraction and analysis.\n\n2.1.

Authors can ensure the transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses by using the PRISMA Statement (Liberati et al., 2009). PRISMA is actually developed for health and medical related review. But recently, PRISMA is often utilized within the environmental management field (Shaffril, Krauss, & Samsuddin, 2018). This is because, according to Sierra-Correa and Kintz (2015), PRISMA offers a few valuable advantages towards the systematic review process. The advantages are (i) a clear research questions that permits systematic review will be defined; (ii) the explicitly will identifies inclusion and exclusion criteria; and (iii) it aims to assess huge amount of relevant and available scientific literature as possible in defined time. Thus, those advantages make this method is suitable to be used in other fields, not only field that related to health and medical.\n\n2.2. Information sources and search\n\nThe primary sources of information were the electronic journal databases Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. WoS is a database established by Clarivate Analytics that covers about 256 disciplines such as science, social science, arts, and humanities from >33,000 journals. The temporal coverage of the database is from 1900 until the present. While Scopus is a database that provides by Elsevier that covers that cover 27 major disciplines with +300 minor disciplines such as health sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, and life sciences. Both databases have an Advanced Search tool that allows a rigorous search to find the related result. Boolean operators \"AND\" and \"OR\" were used to combine the strategic terms that had been decided earlier. The strategic terms came from the keyword and synonym of the concept and topic of the research. The studies retrieved after the search are imported into Endnote X9 © 2018 Clarivate software package for the detection and removal of duplicates. Although studies in soil erosion control practices are not limited to only these two electronic journal databases, but they host top peer-reviewed journals with high impacts factors in the field of soil erosion.\n\n2.3."

Eligibility and exclusion criteria\n\nFew eligibility and exclusion criteria (Table 1) drive the search in the journal database which is the literature type, language, countries, and timeline. Only an online-based peer-reviewed article journal with empirical data was selected. This review leaves out valuable sources of information such as book, book chapter, book series, review article, and conference proceedings though some have empirical information as they are not always peer-reviewed. This is because peer-reviewed journal articles are informed by an interest in empirical studies that have gone through a rigorous research process to establish findings and conclusions (Shittu, 2019). Therefore, our approach intends to make a major effort to address the overwhelming breadth of information on the subject.\n\nNext, the only article that published in the English language was considered to avoid confusion and difficulties in translating the non-English article journal. As for the timeline, a period of six years (2014-2019) was chosen for this systematic review. Studies conducted in the field of soil erosion are very encouraging from year to year. Therefore, the recent few years published articles about soil erosion control practices are enough to help in a better understanding of the suitable method to be used in dealing with a current soil erosion problem. Thus, people that involve in managing soil erosion can refer to these selected articles to practice the method that being tested in current research. Lastly, the objectives of this article are to focus only on Asia's agricultural land. Therefore, only articles focused on the Asian region are selected.\n\n2.4.

The keywords were obtained from the previous studies to find the synonym and the same keywords and related to soil erosion, control practices, and agricultural land was used (Table 2). Two duplicate articles were removed using Endnote X9 © 2018 Clarivate. The second phase is the screening. This phase included the records after duplicates were removed, and records were screened and excluded (Sierra-Correa & Kintz, 2015). At this phase, out of 4593 articles eligible to be reviewed, a total of 2135 articles were removed. The third phase is eligibility that shows full-text articles assessed and excluded (with reasons) such as i) the article did not focus on soil erosion control practices in Asian agricultural land; ii) the control practices proposed is not to be applied in agricultural land; iii) the control practices been proposed is not to mitigate soil erosion but for other reasons such as for improving soil water infiltration and to control pollutant from soil erosion; iv) soil erosion happened because of wind factor. A total of 380 articles was excluded in this phase. The last phase of the systematic review procedure resulted in a total of 39 articles that were used for the qualitative analysis. The selected articles are the articles that i) focus on the technique of controlling soil erosion in the agricultural field; ii) research done proved that the practices are suitable to be applied in agricultural land; iii) soil erosion that happened is associated with rainfall, farming practices, and topography.\n\n### 3.

Agronomics and agrostological practices are both considered as a biological method. The 11 sub-themes are tillage operation, intercropping, cover crop, mulching, organic matter, cultivation grass, contour farming, bunds, micro basin tillage, contour terrace, and geo-textile. The result (Refer Fig. 2 and Table 3) clearly shown that tillage operation and mulching dominate the type of conservation practices that are used to control soil erosion. Fig. 2 shows that tillage operation is the highest control practices being tested for the past six years (22.73%), followed by mulching (21.21%), cover crop (18.18%), cultivation of grass (15.15%), and others control practices."

Tillage operation\n\nThere is a total of 15 studies that focus on tillage operation in a way to control soil erosion in the agricultural area. From the field experiment been done by S. F. Guo et al. (2019) in sloping farmland hilly regions of Southern China, the result indicated that compared to the downslope tillage practices, cross ridge tillage reduced the average annual runoff by 6.11%-64.2%. Dai et al. (2018) have also used downslope tillage and contour ridge tillage in the field study in Southern China to reduced soil erosion in farmland. In both tillage plot, the runoff was reduced under heavy rainfall by 10% for downslope tillage plot and 49% for contour ridge tillage plot. Satriawan et al. (2015) have tested ridge tillage practices for three major crop plantations in Indonesia, which are oil palm, cocoa, and areca. As a result, in the cocoa plot, a combination of ridges with groundnut as a cover crop produced the lowest erosion, which is 8.20 t/ha."

While in the areca plot, the implementation of ridges and maize produced the lowest erosion which is 4.64 t/ha. In the oil palm plot, ridge and maize treatment produced the second-lowest erosion which is 12.33 t/ha.\n\nAccording to the study done by L. Wang et al. (2019), combining different tillage operations with few mulching techniques gave out a satisfying result. The practices that they used are conventional tillage with straw removal, conventional tillage with straw returning, reduced tillage with straw removal, and reduced tillage with straw returning. The reduced tillage with straw returning has the lowest mean annual runoff (90 ± 50 mm) from the averaged overall experiment's years compared to the other three practices.\n\nThe no-tillage practice is also one of the most popular tillage operations to control soil erosion. The no-tillage practice is a practice that keeps the natural physical soil properties of the whole soil layer that allows microbial and biotic activities to increase the infiltration, bulk density, wilting point and field capacity (Ahn & Kim, 2016). From the field experiment been done by Ahn, Choi, & Kim, 2016 in one of the South Korean agricultural areas showed a decrease in the runoff ratio by 10.5% for the no-tillage plots. In another study done by Ahn and Kim (2016), there are 22.5% reductions in the runoff ratio in the no-tillage plot, which is only 19.4% compared to 41.8% in the conventional tillage plot. While the study was done by Choi Y., Won, Shin, Park et al., (2016), the runoff ratio of the no-tillage plot decreased by 64.9% compared with the conventional plots.\n\nIn a rain-fed agricultural area of China, data from a rainfall simulation on soils showed that cumulated infiltration was significantly increased, and runoff was decreased from no-till practices that combined with stubble retention. The soil erosion loss from the erosion was reduced by 62.4% (Lingling et al., 2014). Tang et al."

      "content": "The soil erosion loss from the erosion was reduced by 62.4% (Lingling et al., 2014). Tang et al. (2015) experimented with testing the relationship between soil erosion and three tillage practices with subtropical monsoon climate in the Hilly Purple Soil area in China. The three tillage practices are minimum tillage, conventional tillage, and seasonal no-tillage ridges. The result showed that seasonal no-tillage ridges practices reduced the soil erosion and surface runoff amount compared to the other two tillage operations. The percentage of the micropores can be increased in the soil from the no-tillage practices. Thus, this situation will reduce runoff and enhancing the infiltration process. Ghosh, Dogra, et al. (2016) and Ghosh, Meena, et al. (2016) have practiced the minimum tillage method for their studies in India. The minimum tillage is a process of 50% tillage reduction. The mean soil loss and runoff from the field experiment in both studies decreased by practicing the minimum tillage method that been combined with proper nutrient management and a vegetative barrier.\n\nLi et al. (2019) tested different surface roughness effect on soil loss produced by four different tillage operation which are contour drilling (uses a 'Lou' plow to create furrows and soil ridges), artificial digging (manual farming using narrow hoe), manual hoeing (broad hoe to cultivate soil) and contour plowing (uses a single plow to prepare a fine sowing bed and creates no furrows). The results showed the random roughness of surfaces with different tillage practices were ranked as contour drilling > artificial digging > manual hoeing > contour plowing > no-tillage control. From the experiment also, it can be concluded that the reduction effect of surface roughness on soil erosion decreased with increasing slope gradient, leading to increased soil erosion. In other studies, L. Wang, Dalabay, et al. (2017) did a research study on the effect of tillage practices on runoff and soil erosion from the Loess Plateau, China."

Four types of tillage being tested to control erosion which is contour plow (traditional manual tillage using 'Lou' plow), artificial digging (manual farming using narrow hoe), artificial hoeing (traditional manual tillage using long-handled hoe) and traditional plow (traditional tillage using a single plow). Artificial digging, artificial hoe and contour plow is the most suitable as a summer tillage practices to control erosion because it delayed the time of runoff, decreases runoff and sediment and increase infiltration.\n\n3.2. Intercropping\n\nIntercropping is a practice of growing more than one crop in the same field simultaneously. In this practice, there is one main crop and one or two subsidiary crops. In Krueng Sieumpo, Indonesia, three major crops were tested with interplanting conservation methods to control soil erosion. The crops are areca, cocoa, and oil palm. The results show that ridges + groundnut most effectively reduce erosion on the land use of cocoa, ridges + maize effectively minimize erosion on the areca land use, and Mucuna bracteata is more effective in the oil palm land use (Satriawan et al., 2015). Y. Wang, Cao, et al. (2017) and Wang, Dalabay, et al. (2017) did a study on the effectiveness of the interplanting method on a hilly red soil region of China. The plot experiments were planted with orange trees together with peanut. The result indicated that the orange-peanut intercropping increased the resistance of soil to concentrated flow erosion. In the Himalayan Mountains agricultures area are more vulnerable to soil erosion because of the steep slope. A field experiment was conducted by Sharma et al. (2017) to tackle this issue using intercropping practices. The field experiment was conducted with six treatment combinations of maize crops in the rainy season (June-September) followed by the succeeding crop of the rainfed wheat crop in the winter season (November-April). Cowpea and okra were used as the intercropping crop."

Therefore, cover crops are one of the ways to reduce soil erosion. Dai et al. (2018) used daylily as a groundcover that being planted in two hedgerows on a downslope tillage treatment plot. As a result, the runoff depth was reduced by 37%.\n\nBesides daylily, white clover also acts as an excellent ground cover. Pan, Gao, et al. (2017) used white clover vegetation filter strip (VFS) in an experimental plot to see the ability of the VFS together with the white clover as an agricultural best management practice. The experiment showed that a white clover vegetation filter strip has a good soil infiltration capability and excellent runoff trapping capacity. White clover has also been used as a cover crop in Pan, Gao, et al. (2017) and Pan, Song, et al. (2017) study at Chinese Loess Plateau jujube orchard. The result showed that white clover is a good ground cover. The white clover treatment has the lowest runoff coefficient compared to the other treatment being tested in the study. Other than that, in the simulation study done by J. Huang et al. (2016) in sloping ground jujube orchards, white clover has also been used as a cover crop. The ground cover percentage under white clover cover was the largest in all growth periods caused that the annual mean time to a runoff under white clover cover was the largest and significantly larger than under other treatments (J. Huang et al., 2016). In the study done by J. Huang et al. (2014) for pear-jujube orchards, white clover cover has increased the infil- tration of water amount and soil moisture. From these two studies (J. Huang et al., 2014; J. Huang et al., 2016) shows a good sign because as the time to runoff is high and the infiltration of water amount increased, the chances of soil erosion to occur will be lower."

(2016) used winter cover crops together with split fertilization practices in their study as a control practice to reduce the amount of sediment yield from four major drylands crops (cabbage, potato, radish, and soybean). The cultivation of cover crops showed significant reductions of sediment yield compared to conventional practice. Eshel et al. (2015), used a different type of cover crops to see the impact of each cover crop in potato cultivation in Israel regarding the effects of the cover crops towards soil erosion, runoff and weed suppression. Five treatments plot were built consists of oats, triticale, oats with purple vetch, clover, and rapeseed as a cover crop in potato agricultural site. The overall result shows that under the cover crops treatments, soil erosion, and runoff reduced by 95% and more than 60%, respec- tively. Among the five cover crops, oats are the most efficient cover crop. In Indonesia, Satriawan et al. (2017) used Mucuna bracteata as a cover crop. The result showed the combination treatment of upland rice planted sequentially with soybean + strip Мисипа bracteata as a cover crop in oil palm crops (age 7–25 months, at 15–25% slopes) efficiently reducing the rate of runoff and prevent soil erosion from happening. There are also few other cover crops been used as soil erosion control practices in past studies such as birdsfoot trefoil and crown vetch.\n\n### 3.4. Mulching\n\nAs can be seen in Table 3, many studies applied mulching techniques to control soil erosion. Mulch is any material, organic or inorganic in nature, like sawdust, straw, paddy husk, groundnut shell, crop residues, leaves, paper, and stones that can be spread on the surface of the soil. Therefore, it is protected from raindrop impacts, evade surface crusting, reduce evaporation, and in this manner conserve soil moisture. Pan et al. (2018) used chipped branches as a mulch in a plot-scale soil bin experiment to test the efficiency of this technique to control soil erosion in the agricultural area."

Five treatments were tested, which is bare soil without mulching and four different rates of mulching with chipped branches (pruned branches), which is 0.37, 0.74, 1.11, and 1.48 kg m-2 under two representative rainfall regimes (light rainfall and heavy rainfall). The plot with mulching application reduced runoff by 15.5% and sediment yield by 40.7% compared to the bare soil without mulching applied.\n\nFrom field experiment done by L. Wang et al. (2019), by combining reduced tillage practices with straw returning as mulching has significantly increased soil water content in the 0–10 cm soil depth. This situation showed that the rate of infil- tration is high and lower in the rate of runoff. Dai et al. (2018) tested straw mulching in their study. The result showed that the runoff depths under heavy rainfall and sediment yields were reduced by 81% and 97%, respectively. Y. Wang, Cao, et al. (2017) and Wang, Dalabay, et al. (2017) used rice straw mulch at a rate of 5 t/ha-1 as control practices at a peanut field in China. They also tested a few other treatments, but the rice straw mulch treatment showed the lowest average soil detachment rate among all treatments which is 0.016 kg s-¹ m-2. Lui et al. (2014) conducted an experiment in the citrus orchard using straw mulching practices, and the result showed that the surface runoff is lower when the soil is covered with straw mulch compared to the unmulching soil. Rahma, War- rington & Lei tested the effect of wheat straw mulch rate on the total runoff, and total soil losses from 60-mm simulated rainstorms were assessed for two intensive rainfalls (90- and 180-mm h-1) on three slope gradients typical conditions on the Loess Plateau of China and elsewhere. They evaluated the efficacy of applying mulch to reduce soil and water losses from cultivated soils with three different textures exposed to intensive rainfall conditions."

The result showed that with an optimal mulch rate depending on the slope, soil type, and rainfall intensities, the rate of erosion could be reduced.\n\nIn South Korea, Won et al. (2016) tested rice straw with poly- acrylamide (PAM) and gypsum as mulch in an experimental plot that being cultivated with Chinese cabbage. The total runoff ratio reduces by 29.4% compared to the control plot, even the plot with mulching techniques in a more stepper slope. Choi et al., 2016 prepared three different treatment plots in the sloping agricul- ture field in South Korea. The three management practices are straw mat mulch, straw mat mulch + gypsum, and straw mat mulch + gypsum + PAM. As a result, the straw mat mulch + gypsum + PAM treatment plot showed the highest reduction effect for runoff. The mulching technique has also been tested in sandy loam soil at the upland crop area in South Korea (Ahn & Kim, 2016). By using rice-straw mulching practices, the results of field experiments on the slopes of 3% and 8% for radish and sesame cultivation had decreased for runoff ratio and sediment lost by 9% and 95.9% respectively.\n\nIn the semi-arid region of Iran, three treatments were tested to see the effects of the treatments on soil loss and surface runoff (Rasoulzadeh et al., 2018). The treatments are burning plant residue on the field, returning residues unto the soil surface after har- vesting (mulching), and removing plant residues from the soil surface (control treatment). The result showed as compared to the control treatment, soil loss decreased by 96.5% in the returning residues unto the soil surface after harvesting treatment but increased by 192% in the burning plant residue on field treatment. The effectiveness of returning residues unto the soil surface after harvesting treatment also proved when the runoff volume reading is the lowest compared to the other two treatments.\n\n### 3.5.

Organic matter can be derived from the manure application or organic fertilizer. Manure decomposition has high organic matter content because of the manure decomposition. Y. Wang, Cao, et al. (2017) and Wang, Dalabay, et al. (2017) used organic manure fertilizer, which is fresh pig manure in research to reduces the soil erosion rates in the Red Soil Region of China. As a result, the treatment plot with the manure application has a low detachment rate, and this is because of the high organic matter content that makes it more resistant to detachment in the soil. Manuring can enhance soil aggregation that will improve soil structure. Therefore, this will reduce soil erosion rates. The combination use of organic matter with other soil erosion control practices can reduce soil loss in regions with intense agricultural activity (Q. Zhang et al., 2016). Li et al. (2018) suggested from their research that manure application in combination with seasonal fallow reduces soil erosion.\n\nIn the research done by Q. Zhang et al. (2016), the application of organic matter was used together with contour tillage, and straw mulching practices to control soil erosion. The runoff depth reduced by 19% and 50% in two treatment plots (contour tillage + organic matter and contour tillage + organic matter + straw mulching). The soil erodibility values under the two-treatment plot also decrease respectively by 14% and 30%. Ghosh, Dogra, et al. (2016) used farmyard manure and poultry manure in a few treatment plots for maize and wheat crops that combine with other control practices to increase the organic matter in the soil. The reduction of runoff and soil through bio-resources (farmyard manure and poultry manure) from this study is expected as carbon input from organic matters helps in the formation of more water stable macro-aggregates.

Cultivation of grass\n\nCultivation of grass is one of the agrostological methods that suitable to apply in eroded agricultural land. Few types of grass and non-edible plant been used to control soil erosion in agricultural land. Ten studies use the agrostological method as a method to control soil erosion. Q. Wang et al. (2018), tested the effect of two types of grass hedges (Melilotus hedges; Pennisetum hedges) on runoff loss under different rain intensities and slope gradient on a maize field. Both of the grass hedges decreased surface runoff by 27%-72%. According to Q. Wang et al. (2018), the Pennisetum grass showed better efficacy compared to Melilotus grass, especially under high rain intensity. G. H. Zhang et al. (2015) used Bahia grass that planted in two ways as a soil erosion control practice. The first way is the citrus trees and Bahia grass was planted on the rain-fed terrace bed. The grass was planted on the bunds. Secondly is the horizontal terrace of orchards with Bahia grass planted on the riser (10%-50% vegetation cover). The result showed that the Bahia grass planted on the riser and bunds is a useful method for soil erosion conservation on sloping red soil land in China."

All four studies use the vegetative filter strip method to plant the cocksfoot. From the four studies, Huang et al. (2016) and Huang et al. (2014) concluded that cocksfoot seemed to best the best vegetative ground cover for rainfed sloping jujube orchards and in pear-jujube orchards on dry slopes respectively. Mo et al. (2019) used Bermuda grass to reduce the amount of runoff in sloping citrus land, Southern China. They carried out four runoff plot experiment: (i) no vegetation, bare land (BL); (ii) conventional treatment, citrus without grass cover (CK); (iii) citrus with strip planting of Bermuda grass (SP); (iv) citrus with full cover of Bermuda grass (FC). Results showed that the annual runoff volumes were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced using SP (27.2 mm) and FC (33.0 mm) compared with CK (311.4 mm) and BL (456.7 mm) treatments (Mo et al., 2019).\n\nIn India, two studies used Palmarosa grass and Panicum grass as a vegetation strip in terms of controlling soil erosion. In both studies (Ghosh, Dogra, et al., 2016 & Ghosh, Meena, et al., 2016), cultivation of Palmorasa as vegetative barriers along with organic amendments, weed mulch application and minimum tillage is effective in decreasing runoff and soil erosion. Results also show an improvement in soil quality and an increase in soil system productivity.\n\n3.7. Mechanical method\n\nFrom the systematic review procedure, there are only a few studies that adapted the mechanical method as a way to control soil erosion. The first mechanical method is terracing contour. Terracing is a process of dividing the long slope into more short slopes. Therefore, there will change in the landform and reduces the slope gradient."

Four experimental plots were set up consists of terraced orchard (3°), terraced cropland (3°), unterraced orchard (25°), and unterraced cropland (25°). The results show the average runoff coefficient of the terraced plot (orchard and cropland) was decreasing by 47.2% compared with the unterraced plot, and the average erosion rate of the terraced plot was reduced by 83.9% compared to the unterraced plots. Narrow terraces are also one of the terracing methods being implemented to control soil erosion in agricultural land.\n\nIn the Black Soil Region of Northeast China, a plot experiment was conducted to assess the effect of micro basin tillage as a mechanical method to control soil erosion in agricultural land (Sui et al., 2016). Results indicate that by using micro basin tillage, runoff and sediment rate reduced by 63% and 96%, respectively. G. H. Zhang et al.

Farmers will plant the crops across a slope by following its elevation contour lines. Soil erosion rate will be reduced by practicing contour farming in agricultural land because the arrangement of plants will break up the flow of water and increase the rate of infiltration. Fan et al. (2015) tested contour hedgerows farming to control soil erosion on sloping land in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. They built few experimental plots of rows mulberry on a contour hedgerow with a mustard-corn rotation and one control plot (no mulberry hedgerow with mustard-corn rotation). The result shows that by planting mulberry in a contour hedgerow, the amount of runoff and soil erosion significantly reduces compared to the control plot, which adapts a conventional practice (no hedgerows).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis study has attempted to systematically analyze the existing literature on control practices of soil erosion in Asia agricultural land. Heavy perception, intensive farming, and topography have led to soil erosion that needed to be controlled. A rigorous review sourced from the Web of Science and Scopus has resulted in 39 articles related to research on soil erosion control practices in Asia agricultural land. Three themes and 11 sub-themes emerged within the scope of this review. This review shows that the research on control practices that been adapted in Asia between the year 2014 until 2019 are more focused on the biological method rather than the mechanical method. The biological method consists of agro- nomics practices and agrostological practices. Tillage operation and mulching are the most control practices been used and suggested in the year 2014 until 2019 to control soil erosion in Asia agricultural land. Asian region itself consists of a variation of climates such as tropical, subtropical climate, Mediterranean, and temperate climate. Thus, this discussion will be divided according to the country in the result focusing on climate regimes.\n\nChina is one of the biggest countries in the world. Some parts of China fall under tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate climate. Therefore, the control practices being applied in China to control soil erosion are varied."

Therefore, the control practices being applied in China to control soil erosion are varied. According to the systematic review that has been done, most research in China about soil erosion control practices in agricultural land is located in the wet sub-tropical area. In the wet sub-tropical area, many control practices have been applied because of the seasonal variation. Some places will be planted with different crops in winter and summer. Tillage opera- tion is the most favorable techniques to be tested to control soil erosion in agricultural land. In China, modern research on conser- vation tillage, such as no-tillage started to get attention as an effective way for reducing soil erosion, and this explains the big number of articles from China in the past six years. The conserva- tion tillage (no-tillage) has lots of benefits that gain acceptance in many parts of the world in terms of enhancing global sustainable agriculture (Kassam et al., 2012). The conservation tillage systems have many favorable effects on soil structure and have been re- ported in different soil types and climates (Oyedele, Schjonning, Sibbesen, & Debosz, 1999).\n\nHowever, for no-tillage practices, the adaptability of the pro- cedures may be different from one place to another based on the climate and other ecosystem conditions (Golabi, El-Swaify, & Iye- kar, 2014). According to them, the no-tillage method is more management intensive and its success or failure depends on knowledge associated with the soil and other ecosystems condi- tions where no-tillage is practiced. Furthermore, it is being re- ported that the weather conditions in the growing season are vital in the success of no-tillage practices system (Wang, Cai, Hoogmoed, Oenema, & Perdok, 2006). From the report of Food and Agriculture Organization (2012), climate adaption benefits of no-tillage can be\n\n111\n\nsignificant. According to the report, wheat grown under no-tillage practices was more resilient, leading to yield increases over conventionally cultivated crops in the drought and high tempera- ture in one of the Asian countries."

      "content": "According to the report, wheat grown under no-tillage practices was more resilient, leading to yield increases over conventionally cultivated crops in the drought and high tempera- ture in one of the Asian countries. Kargas, Kerkides, and Poulovassilis (2012) stated from their observation that an untilled plot retains more water than tilled plots. There are more stable aggregates in the upper surface of soils been associated with no-till soils than tilled soils and this resulted in high total porosity in no- tillage plot (Busari, Kukal, Kaur, Bhatt, & Dulazi, 2015). Therefore no-tillage is recommended for a high temperature area. From the systematic review, by practicing no-tillage and minimum tillage practices, proven that these practices can reduce soil erosion, im- proves soil structure, increases soil water infiltration, and conserves soil moisture. Other than that, ridge tillage practices also are sug- gested to be used to control soil erosion in China.\n\nFrom all of the control practices being listed in Table 3 that being tested in China, mulching is also one of the popular methods. There are two types of basic mulch which are organic and inorganic mulch from the studies that been reviewed. Farmers need to consider which one is better to apply depends on the land use type and climate in Asia. Using an organic mulch will give more benefits to the plants because through time, organic mulches will slowly decompose and release nutrients into the soil and will improve the structure. Other than that, the organic mulch will keep the soil cooler and retain soil moisture levels, and this is suitable for a dry period in Asia. As in China, most of the wet sub-tropical areas will receive rainfall between April to September. Therefore, with the help of organic mulch to retain soil moisture levels in soil, this will help in the period of the low rainfall season. Organic mulch that often used in China is straw mulch.\n\nCover crop and cultivation of grass also play an important role in mitigating soil erosion in China. Cover crops and cultivation of grass have been used for a long time as one of the ways to control soil erosion. A very dense layer of the cover crop will reduce the speed of rainfall when it hits the ground and causing the soil not to splash."

      "content": "A very dense layer of the cover crop will reduce the speed of rainfall when it hits the ground and causing the soil not to splash. A cover crop will allow the soil to absorb water more efficiently because of the improvement in the water holding capacity and infiltration (Taguas et al., 2010) due to the abundant root networks of cover crops that keep soil firmly in place. Furthermore, ground cover such as legume, will not only reduce soil erosion through infiltration, reducing surface runoff, it also will increase the nutrient in the soil which is necessary for crop production since legumes are high in nitrogen. The cover crop and cultivation of grass usually being planted in a row or vegetative filter strip. It will be located between the main crop. In a heavier rainfall event, the plant covers significantly promoted infiltration compared with clear cultivation treatments (Pan, Song, et al., 2017). Therefore, this situation is really needed when the agricultural area in China sub- tropical area having a rainfall season.\n\nHowever, some disadvantages using this method to reduce soil erosion such as the plant cover crop species may compete with the major crop planted for soil water and lead to declines in the yield of the major crops such as fruit plant (Pan, Song et al., 2017). Furthermore, the costs to implement cover crop as a conservation measure includes increased direct costs, potentially reduced in- come if cover crops interfere with other attractive crops, production expenses, difficulties in predicting nitrogen mineralization, and slow soil warming (Snapp et al., 2005). Additionally, a ground cover either cover crop or cultivation of grass will increase the cost for the commercial farmers. The ground cover must be planted at a time, therefore there will be an additional cost for planting the ground cover and then tiling it back under which means the farmers need to pay an extra cost for the labor and machinery. According to Swanson, Schnitkey, Coppess, and Armstrong (2018), at the farm level, establishing a cover crop will increases cost. From their"

From the analysis, cost increases because of the expenses of cover crop seed and the cost to drill it (Swanson et al., 2018).\n\nAnalysis from the systematic reviews shows less number of research on mechanical methods to control soil erosion in Asia agricultural land. The main control practices used under the mechanical method in China's agricultural land are terracing and contour farming. The basic function of terracing is the interception of water, which either absorbed or conducted slowly from the agricultural field, depending on the particular requirements of the locality (Nichols & Chambers, 1938). Xu et al. (2018) stated that climate change had only little influence on runoff and erosion in the terraced system. They also suggested that terracing will be more suitable to be applied in citrus orchard compared to cropland. Micro basin tillage also one of the treatments under a mechanical method that is suitable to be applied in China. It is a conservation practice that requires building individual earth blocks along the furrow (Sui et al., 2016). If this practice is being applied with an optimal block interval, it can be a useful practice not just to control soil erosion but also to control water loss and agricultural diffuse pollution (Sui et al., 2016).\n\nSouth Korea is also one of the countries that are effectively doing research on soil erosion control practices. Most of the research about controlling soil erosion in South Korea focusing more on agronomic practices. South Korea has a sub-tropical and temperate climate. Therefore, soil erosion control practices must be suitable and able to perform well to mitigate soil erosion in their agricultural land. In South Korea, most farmers follow the traditional tillage practices for almost all crops they planted (Choi Y., Won, Shin, Park, et al., 2016). As years passing by, more research showed that conservation tillage could yield as much as conventional tillage and protecting the environment at the same time reducing soil erosion."

From the systematic review, most research in South Korea about conservation tillage is about no-tillage practices. According to Choi, Choi, Lim, and Shin (2005), no-tillage method can be a suitable alternative to reduce soil erosion from the steep uplands in Korea if the crops cultivated are corn, soybean, wheat, and barley. However, in the high mountain alpine fields, the major crops are potato, radish, carrot Chinese cabbage and few other vegetables, moreover, those crop cultures need conventional tillage (Choi et al., 2005). Therefore, researchers and farmers need to consider other control practices and mulching is one of their options.\n\nFrom the systematic review, rice straw mulch has always been the most frequently mulch used to protect the soil surface from being eroded. Rice straw mulch is an organic mulch and give lots of benefits to the soil. However, farmers need to consider that they may need to replenish the organic mulch frequently than the inorganic mulch because it will decompose. If farmers use the inorganic mulch such as plastic film and stone, it doesn't break down, and farmers can save time and money because inorganic mulch does not require regular replacement. From all the articles that used mulching as one of the techniques to control soil erosion, the rate of infiltration is increasing. There are studies shown that the infiltration rate has a positive relationship with the application rate of the mulch. The soil surface is protected from the rain impacts by the application of the mulch. This helps to retain the soil in the same place. There are also studies suggested to use mulch together with soil amendments in South Korea such as PAM and gypsum to help mulching to be more effective. PAM and gypsum will increase soil cohesion, reducing soil detachment and transport (Won et al., 2016). Thus, by combining the mulching technique with soil amendments, soil erosion rates can be reduced more efficiently.\n\nAlthough there is no recent research done about using the mechanical method in South Korea agricultural land to control soil erosion, but this method already been practiced in South Korea upland.

Choi et al.

India climate is ranging by most of the area is tropical, and some part is a sub-tropical and temperate climate. Like in every other country, tillage operation is the most considerable practice used to control soil erosion in India. Recent studies in India about tillage method are suggesting to use minimum tillage practices (Ghosh, Dogra, et al., 2016; Ghosh, Meena, et al., 2016). Minimum tillage is a 50% tillage activity reduction. They suggested combining minimum tillage with other control practices such as weed mulching, grass vegetative barrier, and the application of organic matter to see the effectiveness of the practices in sub- temperate agricultural land. Studies show the implementation of the minimum tillage together with the addition of organic matter has enhanced soil aggregation process and water stable aggregates and decreased long term soil erosion on a gentle slope in the Indian Himalayas (Ghosh, Dogra, et al., 2016).\n\nLi et al. (2018) refers to the ideas of Gholami, Sadeghi, and Homaee (2016) and Lalande, Gagnon, Simard, and Cote (2000) that organic matter such as manure application will enhance enzyme activities and microbial biomass reduces splash erosion and delays runoff and sediment concentration time. Farmyard manure is one of the organic matters that farmers used in India. Organic matter is an essential component of the soil that keeps the soil particles clumped together, and thereby this will create resistance against soil erosion. The presence of organic matter is a must for microorganisms to flourish in the soil. Microorganisms secrete some slimy substance which helps in binding together of soil particles. The more frequent farmers added the organic matter to the soil, a structural unit called aggregates would form from the synthesis of complex organic compounds that bind the soil particles."

Rainfall will percolate and infiltrate better downward through the soil because these aggregates help in maintaining the open, loose, and granular condition. Therefore, this situation reduces surface runoff and at the same time the amount of soil erosion will be decreasing.\n\nIn the sub-tropical area of India, maize and wheat are important crops in their agricultural land. Planting a cover crop or as in-situ green manuring such as sunnhemp between maize or wheat brings lots of benefits. Sunnhemp can be grown as dual purpose, firstly as a green manure as well as fiber crop because after harvesting of fiber crop, the top portion (30 cm from the top) can be incorporated into the soil (Sarkar & Ghoroi, 2007) which substantially increase the yield of the major crop. By combining sunnhemp with inorganic fertilizers will lead to more conservation of natural resources, particularly soil of maize-wheat system in a longer period of years (Singh et al., 2017). Cover crop management practice also suitable in sloping agricultural land of north-eastern India. Under the cover management treatment with selective and controlled weed retention has resulted in lower soil loss. According to Lenka et al. (2017), using selective weed retention as cover management practices has brought to a cost-effective management strategy for conserving soil, water and plants nutrients on sloping lands of areas under shifting cultivation in the north-eastern region of India. They also suggested that this practice is suitable to be adopted by farmers who are experiencing similar soil erosion problems in the hilly area of tropical and sub-tropical areas because of the simple and low-cost technology.\nAgro-geo-textiles cover is also one of the suitable control"

These practices not just effective in controlling soil erosion but also help in terms of economy. With proper management, mineral fertilizer applications can be decreased because of less runoff and soil loss (Singh et al., 2019). Not just that, by applying agro-geo-textiles treatment, it will be resulted in cost-effective in the long-term situation. Cost for a synthetic geotextile is very high compared to agro-geo-textiles such as maize straw and Arundo donax where can be found easily and abundantly available.\n\nIndonesia is one of the biggest agricultural producers in the world and it falls under the tropical climate. There are varieties of crop in tropical areas such as oil palm and cocoa. For tropical area, cover crop plays an important role in order to minimize soil erosion. A cover crop that is planted in the intercropping system has lots of benefits towards the cropland. Satriawan et al. (2015) suggested that intercropping combined with ridges tillage is effective to reduce erosion and runoff at cocoa and areca land use. This is because ridges tillage will modify the soil surface to become more rugged and will collect more water to be stored in the soil (Satriawan et al., 2015) instead of becoming a runoff flow. The tropical area will receive rainfall throughout the year. Therefore, it is really suitable to use cover crops in Indonesian agricultural land because the cover crop will reduce the runoff rates from the rain erosivity through the interception process.\n\nOil palm is one of the very important crops in Indonesia and contributes lots to the Indonesian economy. Therefore, it is vital to know the control practices that need to be applied in the oil palm agricultural land. Usually in Indonesia, oil palm being planted on slope areas. The age of oil palm and land slope combined with soil conservation measures had a significant effect on soil erosion (Satriawan et al., 2017). The use of Mucuna bracteata as a cover crop really helps to reduce soil erosion in oil palm agricultural land. The dense root of Mucuna bracteata will bind the soil particles and gives more stabilization to the slope."

In semi-arid regions, soil erosion is one of the most important problems (Rasoulzadeh et al., 2018). According to Marques, Bienes, Jiménez, and Pérez-Rodríguez (2007), there is a clear relationship between soil erosion and rainfall in semi-arid regions which will lead to soil degradation. From the systematic review, a past study suggested to use a mulching technique which is returning plant residue to soil de-creases soil erosion and soil loss by increasing soil organic matter content and decreasing surface runoff (Rasoulzadeh et al., 2018). The researchers stated that removing plant residue and burning it are the most common practices in the region and by burning them has negative impacts on soil physical properties and generate more soil erosion event. Therefore, they suggested returning the plant residue to soil because it has lots of benefits. According to Eshel and Egozi (2013), the soil loss rates under conventional agriculture in the Mediterranean climate is about 4–7 mm year-1. In the central Israel Mediterranean coastal plain, the most common crop is po-tato, watermelon, carrot, sweet potato and cereals. The cover crop has been suggested to be used to mitigate soil erosion in the potato field (Eshel et al., 2015). According to Eshel et al. (2015), oat as a cover crop in potato field supplies efficient cover for the soil surface before the rainy season and allowing penetration into the soil, therefore indirectly lowering the quantities of surface water runoff and peak flow that will decrease soil erosion rate.\n\nFrom Table 3, clearly shown that a smaller number of researches been done about mechanical method on soil erosion control prac-tices in Asia agricultural land. There are more mechanical methods can be applied in the agricultural area to control soil erosion such as basin leaching, contour trenching, sub-soiling and ridging. Mechanical methods are designed to control soil erosion and runoff in\n\n113\n\nagricultural land where biological control practices alone are insufficient to reduce soil erosion to permissible levels (Blanco & Lal, 2010)."

Biological methods that consist of agronomics and agrostological practices are also less expensive than mechanical structures method. This might the reason for explaining the choices of the biological method compared to the mechanical method in Asia agricultural land. However, it is suggested to combine both biological and mechanical methods in the agriculture area to effectively reduce soil erosion rates.\n\nIn terms of economy, choosing the right control practices is really important. This is because, by choosing the right control practices with proper management can give a positive impact in terms of the economy.\n\n### 5. Future direction and conclusion\n\nThis systematic review focusing on the last six years and the result shows that research on control practices to control soil erosion in Asia agricultural land focusing more on the biological method instead of the mechanical method. Therefore, it is suggested that the review efforts in the future will consist of a few points. Firstly, researchers can do a review of research related to mechanical methods to control soil erosion in Asia agricultural land with a longer time review period. Mechanical approaches such as terracing, micro basin tillage and fish-scale pits that used to mitigate soil erosion are proven effectively reducing the soil loss rate. 50 years of the review period will give a good picture and new insight into related stakeholders on how the mechanical method can help to control soil erosion. Next, researchers can also review the efforts and support from local government regarding financial management, training, and policies to control soil erosion.\n\nThis systematic review has highlighted the method and practices to control soil erosion in Asia agricultural land. Soil erosion is one of the main soil degradation phenomena that will threaten the environment sustainability and soil productivity, thus affecting food security. The interaction between rainfall regime, soil properties, vegetation covers, slope characteristics, and land use management will result in soil erosion. Soil erosion in the agricultural area is a severe problem that needs to be tackled from the root. Understanding soil erosion in the agricultural field is an essential step toward developing effective soil conservation strategies."

By substantially decreasing soil loss, conservation practices will conserve the soil's fertility and allow the land to sustain higher crop yields that will have a positive impact on Asia's economy.\n\n### References\n\nAhn, S.

Because land pollution involves extensive multi-source heterogeneous information, identifying the risk of urban soil pollution efficiently and predicting pollution-related events are important for urban environmental management. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have unique advantages in dealing with massive amounts of information. This study attempts to construct a KG of contaminated sites in South China to explore its feasibility and effectiveness in urban soil environmental management. The results demonstrate that KGs have a favorable effect in information retrieval, knowledge reasoning, and visualization. Studied cases in this article demonstrate that the KG model can achieve many functions, including the display of global information of polluted sites, and discovery of regional distribution of characteristic pollutants and main pollutants of specific industries, based on special query syntax. However, this approach is limited by some technical difficulties, such as knowledge mining of natural resources, which must be overcome in future studies to improve the operability of KG technologies.\n\n# 1."

Introduction\n\nDue to the rapid socioeconomic development in China, a significant amount of land has been used for industrial and urban construction. However, the environmental conscientiousness of land operators and related governmental subdivisions cannot keep up with economic development due to the lack of corresponding environmental regula- tions. The soil and groundwater are polluted during the construction or operation period, leading to contamination. This causes negative effects, such as destruction of the environmental system, increasing health risks, and obstacles to economic development (Hong et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015; Luo, 2009; Qu et al., 2016). Owing to the seriousness of soil pollution, the Chinese government has issued relevant laws and regu- lations on soil pollution prediction, early warning, emergency management, and construction land information management (Ministry of Ecology and Environmental PRC, 2016; National People's Congress of PRC, 2018), which has forced related enterprises and governmental sectors to make efforts to enhance soil environmental protection and plan environmental information management.\n\nSoil pollution of construction land is a typical data-intensive issue due to various types of pollutants, including heavy metals, such as mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic, and chromium (Sodango et al., 2018); non-metals such as arsenic and selenium; organic pesticides; oils; phe- nols; benzodiazepines; and detergents and their derivatives from plant's tailings, waste stone, fly ash, and solid waste (Zhao et al., 2015). These pollutants are released from many sources and related factors, including industrial sewage, domestic wastewater, acid rain, exhaust emissions, accumulations, seawater intrusion, and groundwater transfer.\n\n* Corresponding author.

Han et al.\nJournal of Environmental Management 319 (2022) 115685\n\nSecondary diffusion under natural conditions forms a wider range of contamination while the soil in the accumulation site is directly contaminated (Chen et al., 2015). Furthermore, the amount of data collected in the process of soil pollution monitoring, prevention, and early warning is huge, with features of multi-source heterogeneity, fuzzy relationships, and numerous associations (McBratney et al., 2014). In the domain of polluted soil improvement, Okpara et al. (2020) indicated that resources, data availability and uncertainty generated the complexity of decision making in ameliorating soil threats. Therefore, scientific analysis and management of urban soil pollution is an extremely complex task. Zhou et al. (2021) have pointed out that it is necessary to organize the data, relationships, rules, logic, knowledge, and models of urban soil pollution processes into a multi-scale, multi- temporal database, to construct models of urban soil pollution targets with intelligent monitoring and control. However, some shortcomings, such as failure to meet the requirements of monitoring, control, and early warning of urban soil pollution in traditional physical modeling and statistical methods and lack of intelligent systems based on big data analysis have been reported, thus affecting the further application of the huge amount of information regarding pollution.\n\nThe Knowledge Graph, originally proposed in 2013, utilizes data science and artificial intelligence, together with big data and deep learning (Ji et al., 2021). Knowledge graph (KG) technology can obtain structured knowledge from massive data to attain unified expression and efficient storage, and it is an effective means for solving the problem of management of massive data in the soil pollution process. Some studies have implemented KG technology to solve environmental problems. Du et al. (2016) constructed an ontology database for describing soil properties such as soil strength, and soil processes such as soil compaction, to address challenges in combining knowledge and exper- tise in multiple areas while assessing the value of soil environment in the UK. Sermet and Demir (2018) designed an intelligent system, aimed at improving public preparedness for natural disasters, by building a knowledge engine containing voice recognition and natural language processing based on a generalized ontology that extracts data from environmental observations, forecast models, and disaster knowledge databases.

(2020) developed a KG with computer vision al- gorithms to identify hazards on construction sites.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on urban soil pollution based on KGs. Therefore, considering the significant efficiency of KGs in infor- mation storage, query, discovery, and reasoning, this study attempts to construct a KG for contaminated construction sites with functions of pollution information queries, relationship reasoning, and knowledge updates to explore the application of KG technology in soil pollution\n\nprevention, control, and risk assessment in urban areas.\n\nIn this study, we transform the massive heterogeneous data related to soil pollution in urban plots into graph data composed of triples to attain unity of storage and efficient display, mine the hidden information in mass data using graph data algorithm, and explore the feasibility and effectiveness of KG in soil environmental management.\n\n# 2. Material and methods\n## 2.1. Knowledge graph framework\n\nA KG is defined as an interconnected dataset enriched with semantics that can reason the underlying data for complex decision-making (Natarajan, 2020). A KG transforms the intricate document data into numbers of simple triplets consisting of \"entity-relationship-entity\" to achieve rapid response and reasoning for a large amount of information.\n\nThe basic structure of a KG consists of three main components, nodes, edges, and labels (Fig. 1). Any object, such as a place or person can be a node, presenting an entity or its property in KG, edges represent the relationships between nodes, and labels are used to identify different nodes or edges (IBM Cloud Education, 2021).\n\nThe typical process of KG construction is as follows. 1) Exact infor- mation from various structured (panel data, row table), semi-structured (rational database, NoSQL), or unstructured data (documental report, text, images, videos), which can be divided into entity, property, and relationship. 2) Present the extracted knowledge as interconnected triplets (head entity, relationship, tail entity) in the format of RDF, JSON, or attributed graph, 3) Integrate the constructed KG into a computational framework of applications in the real world, such as natural language processing, question and answer systems, multi-hop reasoning, and recommender systems (Ji et al., 2021). The process of KG construction is shown in Fig. 2.\n\n## 2.2."

Distribution of the pollutant via knowledge reasoning-arsenic as the case.\n\nefficient tools to reveal hidden information. In this study, a simple knowledge reason algorithm was used to find featured pollutants of certain industries and regions. The cases proved that KG technologies can quickly and precisely identify the level of environmental risk of the studied sites. However, KG algorithms can help find out related factors that lead to soil pollution such as the industry type, factory layout, background contents of heavy metals in different soils, and knowledge discovery through KG technologies in pollution detection and early warning.\n\nFrom the perspective of contaminated site management, KG is the preferred method to analyze and visualize the complete information of sites, which can assist in discovering and tracing the hidden risks in health and socioeconomic issues. The study results demonstrated that the information search in KG was compatible with multi-source het- erogeneous environmental and chemical big data; thus, it could accu- rately and rapidly disclose the concealed environmental problems in contaminated sites and their surrounding areas, which is of great sig- nificance in optimizing decision-making in soil environmental management.\n\nFinally, the visualization of KG in contaminated sites, presented as a large social network, consisted of a number of triplets while the rela- tionship among entities was clearly shown, which enhanced the read- ability and computability for machine and intuitive interpretability for readers of different kinds of data related to the soil environment.\n\n3.4. Limitations and prospective improvements\n\nThe main limitation was that this study was based on small samples and insufficient information of contaminated sites. The number of samples selected in this study only accounted for a small part of the number of construction sites. Therefore, if the number of sites increased to a large scale, it is doubtful whether the current KG model can ensure certain stability, accessibility, and accuracy in the process of informa- tion storage, retrieval, and inference (Weis and Jacobson, 2021)."

      "content": "On the other hand, A large portion of the semantic material to construct the KG model was derived from structured data such that the process of KG construction was relatively easier than that based on multimode data (Bloem et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2021). And in the process of knowledge retrieval and calculation, it is necessary to replace Cypher language with natural language to reduce the difficulty of popularization and application of KG technologies in the management of contaminated sites. The optimistic prediction is that a few large models or pre-training models based on deep learning have been developed and implemented in some knowledge domains (Liu and Sun, 2021), which can automatically generate multimodal KGs from large-scale data depending on the requirement of downstream tasks. Currently, several natural language process training models for the Chinese corpus have been published and applied to some knowledge domains, including classical poetry (Cui et al., 2021), fairy tales (Lai et al., 2021), and bio-medicine (Zhang et al., 2020). These cases indicate the feasibility of automatic entity extraction and KG construction.\n\nIn addition, data security issue must be considered in the KG model. Under China's current legal system, soil pollution status is sensitive in- formation. It is necessary to avoid leakage of relevant information of soil pollution to the public. Therefore, all information relating to site contamination must be stored in a closed system. This pattern limits the model's ability to handle large-scale data and data sharing between different departments.\n\nFurthermore, the process of KG construction in this study, including data collection, ontology building, and entity extraction, was not suffi- ciently intelligent. For example, basic information of the studied sites was exacted from detailed survey reports of soil environment of the sites, which were firstly manually transformed into the format of panel data and then stored as a graph dataset by staff. This limitation is not only in environmental science issue, Nicholson and Greene (2020) concluded that utilization of automated system was scarce during biomedical knowledge graph construction. Thus, the method of KG construction was typically inefficient and required large numbers of human inter- vention. Therefore, how to achieve automatic and intelligent informa- tion extraction, especially in the issue of soil environment should be the focus of future studies.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis work aims to solve the problem of information stored, man- agement and utilization of contaminated site which was faced by the agents of environmental protection."

Conclusion\n\nThis work aims to solve the problem of information stored, man- agement and utilization of contaminated site which was faced by the agents of environmental protection. Based on the feature of KG and graph data algorithms, this study selected 2000 sites in the most developed regions of China as cases to explore the feasibility and accessibility of KG construction and application in urban contaminated sites and soil environmental management. The results indicated the great potential of KG technology for management of contaminated sites and prediction of soil pollution. And the graph algorithm can help reveal complete information within and around certain sites and contract the hidden risks, which is beneficial for government agencies to implement precise environmental emergent event management measures and\n\n7"

Data-driven machine learning techniques (including Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) and a knowledge-based approach (AHP) are used in this study to pinpoint areas of Chittagong that are particularly susceptible to soil erosion while taking into account 18 soil erosion-regulating parameters. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the selected data-driven machine learning models and knowledge-based models was assessed by utilizing soil erosion and non-erosion sites. When evaluating the fidelity of each model using the ROC and AUC, the RF model was shown to be the most accurate and predictive. There is no poor performer among these models; all have AUCs greater than 67 % (RF = 0.86, ANN = 0.73, SVM = 0.67, CART = 0.67, and AHP = 0.82). According to the findings of the Random Forest model, approximately 71.55 percent of the area exhibited a moderate level of susceptibility to soil erosion. In relation to the land area, the high and low zones accounted for 16.91 percent and 11.54 percent, respectively. The specific area shares of 2256.25, 9548.08, and 1539.67 square kilometers were attributed to the high, moderate, and low danger zones, respectively. The best models' results after comparing models of data-driven and knowledge-based approaches can help to estimate soil erosion risk zones and provide insight into establishing appropriate policies to minimize this issue."

In addition, the methods used in this research might be applicable to assessing the vulnerability and risk of soil erosion events in other areas. As they begin long-term planning to reduce soil erosion, local authorities and policymakers will find the study's results on practical policies and management options quite helpful. |\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nSoil erosion causes long-term losses in biodiversity and agricultural output that can't be restored without human intervention (Bai et al., 2008). Among the various factors influencing soil erosion are soil type, vegetation cover, soil topography, and natural hazards like earthquakes. Long, steep slopes are more prone to soil erosion than shorter, flatter ones (Rahman, 2021). The advancement of complex domains contributes to the emergence of environmental pollution, which in turn results in the phenomenon of climate change. Climate change is also an important issue when considering soil erosion and the first perceptible change in the formation of a region is its greenery, which influences its topography, morphology, climate, and distinctive structure. Often, there appears to be a lack of comprehension among persons regarding the core notion that soil erosion is an expected outcome resulting from poor land utilization, and that its rectification is contingent upon addressing errors in land use and management. The issue persists as a significant concern throughout the Asian mountain regions (Xu et al., 2013). The issue of soil erosion poses a significant challenge in Bangladesh, a developing country that is heavily dependent on agriculture as a key driver of its economy (Krishna Bahadur, 2009). The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh are one of the most prominent examples of the consequences caused by soil erosion in tropical highland regions (Rahman, 2021). Erosion is one of eight soil dangers the European Commission tackles in its Soil Thematic Strategy, and it is called a \"major threat\" in the publication."

The impact of soil erosion is beyond our imagination in terms of damage to fertile land. Soil erosion is also the cause of water pollution and sand sedimentation. As a result, the water ecosystem gets disturbed, and we see a decrease in fish production (Ahmed et al., 2020). CHT is also one of the most prominent nature-based tourist attractions in Bangladesh. Tourists should be carefully developed and managed for better economic flow and environmental protection. Soil erosion causes changes in streambed depth and water quality due to deposition. Flooding along the banks is substantially more severe due to the sedimentation of waterbodies. According to researchers, 43 % of the phosphorus in water is agriculturally produced as a consequence of soil erosion (Mardamootoo, 2015). Soil erosion in Bangladesh is estimated to be between 7 and 120 tons per acre per year, based on previous studies. Soil erosion is responsible for a staggering 50-60 tons per hectare per year (Roy et al., 2021). The erosion risk in hilly locations ranges from\n\n2"

Located in southeastern Bangladesh, the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) are made up of the hill districts of Rangamati, Bandarban, and Khagrachari. Its 13,294 square kilometers are almost entirely mountainous. According UNICEF, 2019, the population is 1.6 million. The city of Rangamati is in Bangladesh's southeastern corner. The coordinates 22° 38′ N and 92° 12' E pinpoint the research zone. You may find forests, rocky and earthy slopes, cascades, rivulets (chara), and river gorges. In between the mountain ranges are narrow stretches of flat land. The soil in the Ran- gamati mountains drains well, while the muddy soils in the valley are poorly drained and often get flooded (Huq et al., 2013). Because of its position, peculiar geomorphic features, and heavy precipitation, this area is one of the most prone to landslides in Bangladesh (Mia et al., 2015). It is possible to classify the region's mountains as either low (300 m) or high (300 m +). The Dupi Tila and Dihing formations support the low hill ranges, while the Surma and Tipam formations support the high hill ranges. Slopes less than 5 degrees are typical in the west, whereas those more than 30 degrees are typical in the east (Rasul et al., 2004; Saha et al., 2004).\n\n2.2."

Description of data\n\nThe initial data gathering and subsequent construction of thematic layers were conducted inside a Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing environment (Table 1). As remote sensing is widely utilized to assess the changing dynamics of ecosystems and environment (Abad-Segura et al., 2020; S. K. Sarkar et al., 2022). Subsequently, we identified the influencing and dependent variables pertaining to soil erosion issues. In this study, complex methods including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were employed to construct more intricate models for predicting soil erodibility and sus- ceptibility. By employing these models, which included a knowledge- based approach based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the production of maps depicting soil erosion hazards was facilitated. In order to select the most optimal model from a range of data-driven ap- proaches, the process of ROC-AUC curve validation is conducted. Sub- sequently, the models of both strategies were evaluated and contrasted through the use of the Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) analysis.\n\n2.2.1.

Until a certain altitude, when the quality of the rock and soil and other geotechnical criteria make further soil erosion less likely, soil erosion rates tend to rise as elevation increases. The slope is an important topographical feature that influences soil stability. Transportation of sediment and runoff in a basin is affected by this (Vemu & Udayabhaskar, 2010). A higher slope increases the risk of soil erosion, whereas a gentler one enhances the channel's carrying capacity. The ASTER DEM served as the basis for ArcGIS's slope raster. The ground's curvature is crucial in identifying erosion-prone areas because it controls the convergences and divergences of downslope water fluxes and influences the processes of surface runoff and sediment transport. When a horizontal plane cuts over the surface at right angles to the direction of greatest slope, we get planar curvature, as described by Mosavi et al. in 2020. The curvature of this plane determines the contour line's form (Shit et al., 2015). Each cell's convexity and lateral concavity, for example, are given numerical values (positive for convexity and negative for lateral concavity). In order to create the curved map, ArcGIS and SRTM-DEM data were used.\n\n2.2.4. Hydro-Climatic parameters\n\nThe likelihood of erosion varies from place to place due to differences in drainage. Permeability, surface resistance, and soil depth (Sham-shirband et al., 2020) all have an effect on drainage density (DD). There was greater surface runoff when there were more drains per unit area (Arabameri et al., 2018). Consequently, regions with a high drainage density are more likely to experience soil erosion (Mosavi et al., 2020) and contribute to a basin's sediment output (Mustafa et al., 2018) than those with a low drainage density. ArcGIS was used to determine the density of drainage and the length of streams. The stream network was extracted from SRTM-DEM (1 arc second) data using Arc Hydro methods. Drainage density was then created using ArcGIS's line frequency and distance from Euclid tools. A channel, also known as a watercourse connection, can significantly influence soil erosion."

A channel, also known as a watercourse connection, can significantly influence soil erosion. When water flows down a stream channel, it can erode the sediment and transport it downstream. Stream connections can also contribute to erosion by altering the movement of water across the landscape (Sweeney et al., 2004). For example, increasing the width or depth of a stream channel can enhance the volume and speed of water flow. This increased flow may result in additional erosion and silt transfer, further degrading the surrounding soil. Stream order is the hierarchy of streams and rivers within a drainage basin, with the tiniest first-order streams and the greatest highest-order streams (Shit et al., 2015). The influence of stream order on soil erosion varies depending on a number of variables, including geography, land use, and climate. In general, higher-order streams are more likely to have a greater influence on soil erosion due to their larger drainage area and consequently greater capacity to convey sediment downstream (Römkens et al., 2002). However, the effect of stream order on soil erosion is also ascertained by parameters such as topography, steepness and soil type. The slope and upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction form the basis of the Topographic wetness index (TWI). Soil and rainfall patterns affect TWI (Pradhan & Kim, 2020). The geographical distribution of runoff sources and saturation zones is described, as is the effect of topographic changes on soil runoff (Mosavi et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021). A bigger discharge capacity corresponds to a higher\n\n6"

Soil moisture, total water storage, and a representation of the basin's soil humidity are all shown by this component (Halefom & Teshome, 2019). Using SRTM-DEM and the Moore et al. (1991) method, TWI values were determined. The number of cells that enter a cell is used to get the flow accumulation (FA) value. Each cell's value in the resultant raster is the sum of the cumulative weights of each cumulative pixel, which indicates the total amount of water that flows downstream from the corresponding cell in the upstream raster. When a lot of SE-affected pixels accumulate in a river's flow water, it's easy to make runoff (Mosavi et al., 2020). The zone of concentrated flow is defined by the cells that experience the greatest amount of flow and is used to determine the stream's channel. Local topographic highs can be characterized by using cells with zero flow buildup. The SRTM-DEM Arc Hydro tools were used to generate the FA raster, which was then combined with a simple D8 flow direction algorithm. Dirt erosion occurs when dirt travels in the direction of water flow, which has a significant impact on soil erosion. One location to another due to an act of water or wind. When water flows over the soil surface, it can pick up soil particles and carry them downstream, resulting in soil erosion."

The direction of water flow determines which portions of the soil are most susceptible to erosion. When water runs downhill, the soil at the bottom of the slope erodes faster than the soil at the top. This is because water runs faster and has more energy near the bottom of the slope, forcing it to pick up and transport more soil particles (Lohani et al., 2020). The flow of water can influence where these channels form and how quickly they grow. The characteristics of the watershed affect soil erosion in hilly areas. The watershed, which is defined as the area of land where all water descends into a single outlet such as a river or lake, affects water flow, sediment transport, and erosion patterns (Amarakul, 2001a; Ghorbanzadeh et al., 2020). Watersheds are responsible for determining the patterns of water\n\n7"

The primary intention of SVMs was to identify the best linear hyperplane for distinguishing between two classes, making them a kind of binary classifier (Vapnik, 1999). In the case of binary classification problems where samples are linearly separable, SVMs attempt to locate a separating hyperplane in the feature space that maximises the distance between positive and negative samples (Pisner & Schnyer, 2019). Based on statistical learning theory and the notion of structural risk reduction, SVM is a machine learning algorithm (Nhu et al., 2020; Tran Van & Prakash, 2020). Using a kernel function and the optimum classification hyperplane are the two main concepts of support vector machines (Yao et al., 2008). Support vectors (H1 and H2) are lines perpendicular to the classification line (H) that pass through the locations on the samples that are most in close proximity to the line (the dots and squares in). The labelling margin is the distance between the two groups. A support vector machine (SVM) is a popular machine learning tool for making accurate predictions with little information. In this analysis, we use support vector machines to map soil erosion vulnerability. It explains how SVM works and how it may be used to create a soil erosion risk map. Three different approaches to landslip susceptibility mapping are then compared with the SVM method: the correlation and regression tree, artificial neural networks, and random forests. Future research directions are discussed, and a review of the use of SVM to landslip susceptibility assessment and mapping is presented. In this data-driven and machine learning-based procedure, the data is divided into two sets: 70 % for training and 30 % for testing.\n\n2.3.2. Random Forest\n\nAn advanced decision tree model, random forest builds several trees for use in regression and classification analyses.

Artificial neural network\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANN) are a kind of AI that may be used to statistically identify the patterns of the intricate interactions that form the basis of geo environmental information. It's malleable because it can roughly estimate the linearity or nonlinearity of a connection between dependent and covariate or factorial variables and a complicated data structure. For rapid decision making, the neural network employs a method wherein it develops several approximations and tries modifications to build a better approximation depending on user-specified criteria (T. Sarkar & Mishra, 2018). Anomaly detection using ANN is a standard method for avalanche risk mapping. The typical architecture of an ANN consists of three layers: input, hidden, and output. Each input value is then multiplied by the total mass of the assembly at each calculation node (Zhao et al., 2010). A neuron-specific restriction named bias is then applied to the combined yields in order to bring them into a reasonable range (Melchiorre et al., 2008). By applying an activation\n</div>\n\n<div>\nfunction to this total, the computational node produces output (Rudra & Sarkar, 2023). By minimizing a learning function that represents the gap between observations and ANN output during training, a non-linear optimization training approach is utilized to construct weights and biases (Nhu et al., 2020). The data-driven and machine learning based procedure utilizes 100 hidden layers for performing the process. 70% of the data is allocated for training purposes, while the remaining 30% is reserved for testing.\n\n2.3.4.

Get started using a dataset that includes both the independent factors and the variable you want to forecast. Utilizing the CART algorithm, build a decision tree.

      "content": "Utilizing the CART algorithm, build a decision tree. The data is partitioned recursively based on predictor variables, and the best predictor variable and split point that optimizes the correlation or regression relationship within each subset are chosen. Whether the dependent variable is continuous (regression) or categorical (classification) determines the dividing criteria. For regression, minimize the variance within each subgroup, and for classification, maximize the homogeneity or purity of each subdivision based on the target variable. The data is subdivided repeatedly into smaller subsets based on the selected variable and split point. This procedure is repeated until a predetermined condition, such as a maximal tree depth or a minimal number of samples in each subgroup, is met. Using the created tree, new data points can be predicted by following the predictor variable values down the tree. The prediction is made by averaging the target variable values within the leaf node that corresponds to the path of the data point. The resultant tree structure illuminates the connections between predictor and target variables. The decision criteria at each node can be read to comprehend how various variables affect the prediction (Saha et al., 2004). In this data-driven and machine learning-based procedure, the dataset is divided into two subsets: 70% of the data is allocated for training purposes, while the remaining 30% is reserved for testing.\n\n2.4. Knowledge-based approaches for soil susceptibility mapping\n\n2.4.1. Analytical Hierarchy process\n\nUsing a variety of criteria, AHP narrows down the options for making a choice and helps choose the best one. Evaluation of potential solutions to a problem by giving each one a number rating depending on how well it satisfies the decision maker's criteria. The potential prediction accuracy of AHP methods and other machine learning techniques has been reported on in many research proving the dependability of machine learning (Tolche et al., 2021). AHP is still one of the most renowned analytical techniques for difficult decision-making process because of its flexibility and applicability (Sinshaw et al., 2021). A decision-making scenario may be described using an AHP hierarchy with numerous levels. To assign values to the variables that characterise the site's suitability, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) uses a pairwise comparison matrix with a scale of relative significance (Raisi et al., 2014; Tairi et al., 2019).\n\n2.5."

The value of a test is often measured by its area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with a bigger area indicating more value. A continuous random variable display style XX, which is the instance's \"score\" (for example, the estimated probability in logistic regression), is often used to produce the class prediction for each instance in binary classification. Instances are classified as \"positive\" when display style X > TX > T and as \"negative\" when the opposite is true, where display style TT is the threshold parameter. If the instance is of the \"positive\" class, then display style XX conforms to the probability density of display style f 1(x)f 1(x), and if it is not, then display style f 0 (x)f 0(x) is used (Biswas et al., 2012). The overall methodological framework is shown in (Fig. 2).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Descriptions of parameters\n\nFrom Fig. 3, the analysis of the slope parameter reveals that the northern portion of our research area exhibits a greater degree of steepness, consequently leading to a higher incidence of erosion within that particular region. It has been determined that the southern section exhibits a greater degree of steepness, as indicated by the Elevation parameter. The rise in soil erosion is a direct consequence of higher precipitation. The parameter inside a curvature map provides information regarding the direction of slope, the location of elevated terrain, the presence of depressions, and the identification of convex and concave regions. The regions located in the northern and southern portions of the map have a greater prevalence of higher convex areas, which consequently experience a higher degree of soil erosion.\n\nThe drainage density parameter exhibits a greater drainage density within the middle region of the land, thereby leading to an elevated potential for soil erosion. Based on the parameter map for Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), it may be inferred that a location with a high TWI value signifies saturation, hence suggesting a heightened susceptibility to erosion within that area. The transverse wave impedance (TWI) exhibits a larger value throughout the center part."

      "content": "The transverse wave impedance (TWI) exhibits a larger value throughout the center part. In the southern region of the Chittagong hill tracts, the length of stream linkages is observed to be greater, which can be attributed to the higher levels of soil erosion in this area. Flow accumulation exhibits significant values in certain areas, as evidenced by the flow accumulation map. Soil erosion is a prevalent occurrence in areas characterized by high flow rates. According to the watershed parameter map, the catchment area has a larger extent in the southern region of the Chittagong hill tracts. This observation implies a higher degree of erosion in the specified area. A positive correlation exists between stream order and soil erosion within the Stream order parameter (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 5 denotes, Areas with a higher density of vegetation see reduced erosion rates. Based on the analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, it is evident that the southern regions of our designated research area exhibit a higher prevalence of vegetative cover, hence indicating a reduced occurrence of erosion in those areas. A resemblance is observed in the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis. The density of vegetation increases as one moves towards the southern region. Consequently, the severity of erosion is reduced. Based on the statistic known as the Soil Brightness Index, it can be observed that the southern region has a comparatively elevated Soil Brightness Index. A high SBI score indicates that the soil exhibits characteristics consistent with a rock type composition. The presence of rocky soil contributes to the stability of the ground, making it less susceptible to erosion.\n\nThe roughness parameter exhibits a lower degree of roughness in the central region. It has been determined that the presence of less rocky terrain leads to an increase in erosion, as evidenced by the utilization of the lineament density measure. It can be inferred from the Soil group parameter that the entire region exhibits uniform brown/grey soil characteristics. The selection was made due to its vital role in my research. Ligaments exhibit greater thickness in the vicinity of the Chittagong hill tracts, an area characterized by heightened erosion. A steeper slope of the hill is observed across the entire area in the Morphology parameter. The increased gradient of the hill contributes to heightened soil erosion (Fig. 6).\n\n3.2."

Soil susceptibility mapping by data driven approach\n\nWith eighteen soil erosion control parameters as training datasets, this research produced four SESM using SVM, CART, ANN, and RF machine learning models (Fig. 7). Each SESM was then assigned to one of three susceptibility groups based on their degree of sensitivity to SE: low, moderate, or high. We found that a large percentage of the basin is vulnerable to soil erosion, suggesting that it may be a problem in this area. According to the SESM, the basin's southern, south-eastern, western, and southwestern regions have high, moderate, moderate, and high risk, respectively. Where there is a high concentration of both uncultivated and cultivated land, the slope and elevation, soil erosion is moderate.\n\nAccording to the SVM-generated SESM (Table 2), 17.69% of the area is comprised of high erosion zones, while 70.60 % is comprised of moderate zones. The remaining 11.71% falls within the zone of low soil erosion. The CART model designated 14.03% as low-risk, 698.5% as moderate-risk, and 16.1% as high-risk. On the other hand, the ANN SESM showed that most of the region (70.85%) has a moderate soil erosion potential, followed by 12.03 % to the low susceptible category and 17.12% in the high soil erosion risk zone. The RF model predicted that 71.55 percent of the region will be eroded. Only 16.59 percent of the terrain was considered high, while 11.54 percent was considered low (Table 3).\n\n3.3. Soil susceptibility mapping by knowledge-based approach\n\n3.3.1. Weight of the soil erosion parameters by AHP\n\nAHP-generated SESM (Fig. 8) indicates that the northern side has a low potential soil erosion zone, whereas the other sides have high and moderate potential zones, respectively. According to the findings, 14.19 % of the entire land is very resistant to soil erosion due to its plant cover."

Validation of models by ROC and AUC (data driven approach)\n\nSoil erosion susceptibility mapping rigor was measured using the ROC-AUC metric. SVM and RF both have metric values of 0.67, whereas CART and ANN both have values of 0.86 and ANN has a value of 0.73. This degree of agreement between the distribution of observed erosional zones and the final anticipated maps is indicative of a moderate to outstanding projection capability across all models. Each model came within a small margin of error of what really occurred. According to the findings, SVM, CART, and ANN all achieve equivalent levels of accuracy. While the ANN, SVM, and CART models were all useful in some ways, the AUC analysis shows that the data driven RF model is the best choice for mapping susceptible soil erosion areas in this particular research region. The AUC values for RF and AHP are 0.86 and 0.82, respectively, when compared to those of the Knowledge-Based Model and the Data-Driven Model. The model and the final forecasted maps of the study area show a high degree of agreement in the settings of existing erosional zones. The AUC suggests that the RF model has more promise than the AHP technique for mapping soil erosion sensitivity in the research area, despite the AHP model's superior predictive performance (Fig. 9).\n\n13"

District wise soil erosion susceptibility by best model (RF)\n\nAccording to research utilizing the RF model (Fig. 10 & Table 4), nearly three-quarters (74.92 percent) of Bandarban lies within a moderate soil erosion zone characterized by high and moderate elevation and a small (3.38 percent) region susceptible to soil erosion. In contrast, Rangamati has a greater concentration of water bodies and 66.37 percent of its land area is covered by a zone of moderate soil erosion. And only 16.79% and 16.84% of the land is vulnerable to soil erosion. In contrast, 73.91%, 17.96%, and 8.14% of Khagrachari, respectively, lie within the moderate, low, and high soil erosion zones.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nNumerous researchers and scientists have utilized extensive modeling to determine accurate methods for mapping soil erosion and, ultimately, how to reduce and eventually stop it. Previous research in CHT has mapped landslide susceptibility, but not soil erosion susceptibility. The alteration in soil quality resulting from soil pollution and soil erosion has a substantial impact on the ecosystem (Alqadhi et al., 2022; Mallick et al., 2022). By using a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision technique, and considering eleven distinct variables, The resulting composite map displays the varying degrees of soil erosion in Chitral, Pakistan, categorized into five distinct classes: very high, high, medium, low, and very low. The studied area exhibits a prevalence of 13 % and 18 % for very high and high erosion, respectively, indicating a significant risk of soil erosion in the region. The primary components impacting the soil erosion process have been identified as elevation, slope, curvature, normalized difference water index (NDWI), and rainfall (Aslam et al., 2021). Using the RUSLE method, Rahman (2021) estimates that woods make up around 69,803 ha (or about 20%) of the total area in the watershed of the study region. Soil erosion rates in high-importance regions are between 49.20 and 86.70 kg/ha/yr. Most soil is lost from forested regions, then from towns and roadways."

      "content": "Soil erosion rates in high-importance regions are between 49.20 and 86.70 kg/ha/yr. Most soil is lost from forested regions, then from towns and roadways. Agricultural fields and cultivated lands are often located on low-lying regions with gradients ranging from 0 to 19 %, while woods are typically found on steep slopes ranging from 37 to 121 %. Rabby (2020) uses machine learning to determine an increase in the high susceptibility zone of 28.7 and 43.1 % for planned and simulated LULC situations, respectively. Also, from (Rabby & Li, 2020) Frequency ratio (FR) and evidentiary belief function (EBF) are two types of bivariate models; by combining them with knowledge-based AHP and multivariate logistic regression, we may increase the accuracy of our landslide susceptibility maps in CHT. In this study, our focus is narrowed to the examination of soil erosion susceptibility. Our findings indicate that among data-driven and knowledge-based models, the random forest model proves to be the most successful for accurately mapping this variable. Based on RF's findings, it is indicated that a considerable proportion of the entire region, specifically 71.55 percent, is susceptible to experiencing substantial soil erosion. The regions characterized by higher elevation and lower elevation accounted for 16.91 percent and 11.4 percent of the total land area, respectively. Upon analyzing the district-specific data, it is evident that a significant portion of Bandarban (specifically, 74.92 percent) is situated within a zone characterized by a moderate risk of soil erosion. This moderate risk is attributed to the district's considerable elevation, which is classified as high or moderate. Conversely, only 21.71 percent and 3.38 percent of the district's territory are categorized as being at greater and lower risk levels of soil erosion, respectively. In contrast, a significant portion of Rangamati, around 66.37 percent, is characterized by a moderate soil erosion zone and a substantial presence of water bodies. The regions with the highest susceptibility to soil erosion encompass a mere 16.79% and 16.84% of the total land area."

Conclusion\n\nUsing data-driven machine learning approaches and knowledge-based processes, this research aimed to locate areas of soil erosion in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. If put into practice, the models developed in these studies may significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency. Therefore, the RF, SVM, CART, and ANN models should be used, with the user choosing the appropriate parameters according to the specifics of the region's geography and climate. The RF model provides the best fit, performance, and prediction when compared to the other models (AUCs = SVM = 67%, ANN = 73%, RF = 86%, AHP = 82%, and CART = 67%). On top of that, it claims that when compared to the knowledge-based model, the soil viability mapping produced by the data-driven approach is more accurate. All models have inherent flaws, but they all provide useful information that may be used to better manage land resources in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Soil erosion is more common in the highlands of Bangladesh's CHT watershed, whereas it is less of a problem in the lowlands. CHT regional development and land use planning may benefit greatly from the study's susceptibility maps. The majority of the western CHT was classified as low susceptible on the susceptibility maps. Strict land-use planning should be adopted in high and very high vulnerability zones, with authorities and stakeholders taking precautionary steps for development activities like road building. The findings of this study would benefit SDG Goals related to \"Life on Land,\" \"Climate Action,\" \"Zero Hunger,\" and \"Sustainable Cities and Communities.\" Soil erosion contributes to climate change in numerous ways, including the loss of arable land, a decline in agricultural output, and an increase in sedimentation in aquatic bodies. Soil erosion is a significant contributor to climate change, but this study mitigates this effect by paving the way for more precise erosion control strategies and environmentally responsible land management."

Significant losses in agricultural production and hazards to food security are a result of soil erosion. The findings may inform concerted action to preserve farmland, enhance sustainable agricultural practices, and advance SDG 2's objective of ending world hunger. Goal 15 of the Sustainable Development Goals, \"Life on Land,\" is concerned with the management and conservation of terrestrial ecosystems, and thus has a direct consequence on the research presented here. By mapping soil erosion susceptibility, the initiative aims to identify vulnerable areas and provide crucial information for land management measures to halt further degradation and promote sustainable land use in the CHT. Both urban and rural regions are designated CHT. This research contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 11 by encouraging informed urban planning and land use decisions, which in turn promotes sustainable development and resilient communities in the region. In order to address the issue of soil erosion in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh, it is imperative to adopt a comprehensive and diverse strategy. To begin with, it is imperative to advocate for the extensive implementation of terracing and contour farming practices as a means to decelerate water runoff and mitigate soil erosion on inclined terrains. Furthermore, it is imperative to give precedence to reforestation initiatives that focus on utilizing indigenous plant species. This approach serves the purpose of stabilizing the soil and mitigating the risk of erosion. Furthermore, it is imperative to involve local communities in watershed management initiatives in order to collaboratively tackle erosion concerns and establish sustainable land utilization strategies. In conclusion, it is imperative to implement rigorous rules pertaining to activities such as logging and land usage in order to mitigate erosion-prone practices. This measure is crucial for safeguarding the long-term sustainability of the region's delicate ecosystem and the welfare of its residents.\n\nFunding\nNone.\n14"

Accurate assessment of landslide disaster susceptibility is of great significance in enhancing the ability of accurate disaster prevention. To address the problems of strong subjectivity in the selection of assessment indicators and low efficiency of the assessment process caused by the insufficient application of a priori knowledge in landslide susceptibility assessment, in this paper, we propose a novel landslide susceptibility assessment framework by combing domain knowledge graph and machine learning algorithms.

We select the optimal model and optimal feature combination among six typical machine learning (ML) models to construct interpretable landslide disaster susceptibility assessment mapping. Experimental validation and analysis are carried out on the three gorges area (TGA), and the results show the effectiveness of the feature factors recommended by the knowledge graph characterization learning, with the overall accuracy of the model after adding associated disaster factors reaching 87.2%.

Therefore, it is of great significance to utilize efficient and accurate evaluation\ntechniques for landslide susceptibility evaluation and the identification of high-risk and\nhigh-incidence areas of landslide geohazards to improve the level of geological disaster\nforecasting, and regional geological disaster prevention and mitigation work.\n\nLandslide susceptibility assessment usually combines historical disaster inventories\nwith manually selected characterization factor data, and the assessment models are mainly\ncategorized into physical models, expert models, statistical models, and machine learning\nmodels [4-7]. Each susceptibility model has its own advantages and disadvantages in\ndifferent scenarios. Physical-based models provide the highest assessment accuracy at\nsmall spatial scales and with large amounts of exploration data, but it is due to these\ntwo types of characteristics that physical-based models do not achieve better assessment\nresults at wide-area scales and with sparse data [8]. Expert-based models rely on expert\nexperience combined with subject matter expertise, and the subjective quantitative setting\nof landslide condition factor weights, to classify the sensitivity level. However, expert-\nbased models are highly subjective, making it difficult to obtain objective and quantitative\nassessment results [9]. Statistically based models select and handle a large number of\nlandslide condition factors, and the model constructs mathematical methods to mine the\nrelationship between the factors to divide the landslide susceptibility. But there are some\nlimitations of statistically based models when facing the nonlinear and complex relationship\nbetween the factors [10]. Machine learning models do not rely on the function of rules\nand a priori knowledge too much. Machine learning models select relevant conditioning\nfactors and adjust parameters by learning the training data to minimize the mathematical\nfunction of the error between the predicted output and the true label [11-13]. Recently,\nmachine learning models have been widely used for landslide susceptibility assessment,\nsuch as logistic regression [14], artificial neural network [15], support vector machine [16],\ndecision tree [17], random forest [18], plain Bayes [19], gradient boosting tree [20] and so on.\nHowever, the feature factors selected by the above methods have the following problems."

UIE Model\nThe UIE model solves the information extraction tasks of entities, relationships, and events simultaneously using only one model [36]. The framework splits the information extraction task into two elements, spotting and associating, and the prompt constructed based on spotting and associating is called the Structural Schema Instructor (SSI), which is connected to the experimental text. After the sequence of SSI and experimental text is input into the UIE model, the output is obtained as the Structured Extraction Language (SEL), so that various complex information extraction tasks for large-scale text can be modeled in a unified way, and the UIE model framework is shown in Figure 3. The UIE model learns a language model of the text's own probability and uses this probability to predict the output entities and relationships, thus reducing the need for large-scale supervised text extraction and the need for a large-scale supervised text extraction, thus reducing the need for large, supervised datasets.

Knowledge Graph-Based Feature Factor Recommendation Model\n\nThe landslide knowledge graph consists of three main parts, namely the characteri-\nzation factors selected for landslide susceptibility assessment in different regions under\nexisting researches, the relevant features of historical landslide events, and the manually\nset terrain areas and administrative areas. In the knowledge graph-based feature factor\nrecommendation mode, firstly, the PairRE is used to carry out the characterization learning,\nand the area with high relevance to the target area is selected through the regional spatial\nsimilarity calculation; the landslide susceptibility assessment factors of this area are taken\nas the alternative factor set. The attribute similarity is calculated, and the high similarity\nfactor is eliminated to realize the alternative factor set to reduce the redundancy, and to\nrealize the selection of the evaluation indexes of landslide disaster assessment.\n\n3.2.1. Landslide Knowledge Graph Representation Learning\n\nEntity relationships in the landslide knowledge graph are more complex, with one-to-\none, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. In this research, we use the PairRE\nfor knowledge graph representation learning [37], which is able to adequately capture\nthe semantic links between entities. Specifically, for a given triple, the PairRE embeds the\nrelations in the graph as two vectors, rH and rT, which project the head entity h and the\ntail entity t into the Euclidean space, i.e., the PairRE allows an entity to have a distributed\nrepresentation in different relations. The projection operation is performed using the\nHadmard (0). PairRE ultimately determines whether the embedding representation of each\nternary is justified by calculating the distance between the two vectors after projection.\nIntuitively, all embedded representations in PairRE are on a hypersphere (see Figure 5).\n\n<center>\n<br>\n\n</center>\n\nFigure 5. Spatial mapping of the PairRE model.\n\nThe formal representation of the objective function of PairRE is as follows:\n\nfr(h,t) =||horH-torT|| (1)\n\nwhere h, rH, rT, t ∈ Rd and ||h2|| = ||t2|| = 1, ||*|| are the parameters of the vector, which\nrepresent the \"length\" of the vector.\n\n3.2.2."

The entity types include spatial location, topographic area, administrative area, identification features, feature categories, and associated disaster (e.g., Figure 7). Among them, the spatial location refers to the spatial location where the historical landslide events occurred, such as the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Zigui County, etc.; the terrain area and administrative area represent the topography and administrative area belonging to the spatial location where the historical landslide events took place, respectively, such as Shui Cheng County, Liupanshui City, which is located in a topographic region of the Southwest China Mountainous Region, and an administrative area of the Guizhou Province. The identifying characteristics indicate the characteristic factors selected for assessing landslide susceptibility in the current research, such as elevation, slope, faults, etc.; feature category indicates the category to which the identifying feature belongs, e.g., elevation, slope for topographic features, fault density, and the type of geologic body for geologic environment. The associated disaster is another type of geologic disaster occurring in the area where landslides occur, e.g., avalanche, mudslide, etc.\n\nAdministrative Area\nBelong\nSpatial Location\nAssociated\nAssociated Disaster\nTerrain area\nBelong\nUse\nIdentifying\ncharacteristic\nBelong\nFigure 7. Landslide knowledge graph entity types and relationship.\nBelong\nCharacteristic\nCategory\nIn this research, due to the existence of two kinds of text data in Chinese and English, this research paper manually constructs an entity-relationship Chinese-English comparison library to unify the extracted entity-relationships into English expressions.\n4.1.2. Data Labeling\nThis research adopts a fine-tuning modeling strategy based on ERNIE-UIE, so a small amount of labeled data is required. This utilizes the open-source annotation tool \"Doccano\" to extract 100 texts from the original data for annotation (an example of annotation is shown in Figure 8). The initial labeled data is converted into data with Prompt, and the specific text of all tail entities is stored in \"result_list\", while the head entities are combined with relationship types to form a specific \"prompt\"."

It may be because the text only selects the identification features, but does not describe the category to which the features belong, so there is a missing problem; or it may be that, although the identification features are categorized in the text, they are displayed in multimodal forms such as graphs and tables, and the method selected in this research is not designed to extract the information of the other modal forms. In order to improve the accuracy of entity extraction, the research uses manual classification methods to reclassify the recognition features. According to the entity relationship in Table 1, the mapping table is constructed and mapped to get the entity type label of the tail entity. The final processing results are de-emphasized and corrected to obtain a total of 2167 entities and 2352 entity relationship triples.\n\n4.1.4.

Comparison of Results from Different Machine Learning Model Approaches\nFigure 13 shows the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score of the six ML models without parameterization. In analyzing the performance of the machine learning models with and without associated disaster data included, it can be seen that the inclusion of the associated disaster as a variable has a significant effect on model performance.\nWhen the selected feature factor does not include the concomitant factors, LR and SVM perform poorly, with their accuracy below 60%, while the RF, GBDT, XGBoost, and CatBoost accuracies are all above 65%. When the factors related to the associated disaster are included, the accuracy of RF, GBDT, and CatBoost are all above 68% accuracy, which is an improvement of 3%, and the F1-score is above 0.7, with an average improvement of 0.1. Therefore, by evaluating the associated disaster before and after inclusion in the six machine learning models, we can demonstrate the validity of the three types of factor classifications screened in landslide disaster knowledge graph, as well as minine the large connection between the associated disaster and landslides. The most effective RF is selected, and the factors related to the associated disaster are included for landslide susceptibility assessment."

Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Based on RF\nCombining 22 feature variables such as terrain features, geological environment, soil, river, and the associated disaster into the RF, the score of the magnitude of its contribution to the RF is calculated according to the function. The RF is randomized, so different feature importance scores are obtained from each calculation. In order to avoid errors caused by randomness, the feature importance calculations are performed for five iterations, ranked and selected by the average importance score of the feature variables. A clear difference in the feature importance scores of the different feature variables can be seen (Figure 14a). Elevation is the most important feature variable with an importance score of 0.079."

Figure 14b shows the re- lationship between the number of features and accuracy based on feature importance scores under random forest classification. The analysis shows that as the number of feature variables increases, there is a small fluctuation in the classification accuracy, and the overall change shows a tendency of first increasing and then fluctuating to stabilize. As the number of feature variables increases, the amount of categorization information develops from insufficient to gradually sufficient, and the categorization accuracy gradually improves. However, with the continuous addition of feature variables with lower feature importance scores, the phenomenon of information redundancy begins to appear, which affects the improvement of accuracy to a certain extent and leads to a downward trend in accuracy. When the number of features reaches 12, the classification accuracy reaches a maximum value of 74.11%. This indicates that the random forest classification method is insensitive to changes in the number of features, has high robustness, and is not prone to cause overfitting even when the number of features is large. When the number of feature variables is small, the random forest method can also achieve high classification accuracy. Therefore, the classification combination of \"DEM, ECV, CDy, FDy, CDe, SLOPE, MDe, GCe, FDe, SPC, USDy, RDy\" is the optimal feature combination.\n\n<center>\n\n|      | DEM  | ECV    |\n| ---- | ---- | ------ |\n| GT   | 0.08 | CDy    |\n| GCy  |      |        |\n| ST   | 0.06 | CDe    |\n| RDe  | 0.04 | FDY    |\n| MDy  | 0.02 | MDe    |\n| GPDy | 0    | SLOPE  |\n| GPDe |      |        |\n| USDy |      | ASPECT |\n| SPC  | RDy  |        |\n| GCe  | DFe  |        |\n| USDe | SFC  |        |"

Discussion\n\nWith the increase in landslide-related research, it is an important task to integrate a priori knowledge in the landslide domain and mine implicit correlations to support high-precision and high-efficiency landslide disaster susceptibility assessment. Although many studies have been conducted on landslide susceptibility modeling under multi-model and multi-feature, for the selection of feature indicators, due to the varying time of the occurrence of disasters in landslide inventories, which leads to the problem of temporal matching of, e.g., NDVI and meteorological rainfall is not fully considered, it is necessary to design suitable feature factor recommendation models to achieve equivalent or efficient assessment effects. In addition, much landslide-related information contained in landslide disaster reports and landslide event encyclopedias has not been effectively utilized, such as the concomitant disaster density and Euclidean distance factor found in this paper through the landslide knowledge graph, and the integration of the existing methodology and technology to mine the implicit relationships in the unstructured data, which is of scientific significance to improve the accuracy of the assessment.\n\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of the spatial correlation and attribute similarity in this paper, the study area selected in this paper is not the Three Gorges Reservoir Area in the traditional sense, but the adjacent area is added on the basis of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. Compared to existing research on the traditional Three Gorges Reservoir area., Fang et al. (2021) [60], Song et al. (2024) [61], and Yu et al."

      "content": "Remote Sens. 2024, 16, 2399\n25 of 28\nconstructed in this paper, combined with the feature factor recommendation model, a total of 12 types of evaluation indexes are selected from five categories of Topographic Features, Geologic Environment, Soil Type, Rivers and Associated Disaster, and combined with the random forest model with hyperparameter optimization, the susceptibility assessment of TGA is carried out, and the optimal accuracy reaches 87.20%, which proves the superiority of the selection of feature indexes based on the knowledge graph established in this paper.\n\nIn this paper, non-landslide sample points are currently selected only in accordance with existing studies and the first law of geography; future research needs to consider more constraints to improve the production of non-landslide data in order to improve prediction accuracy. In addition, this study only utilizes single-modal unstructured text for knowledge mining. Future work should extract and mine multimodal landslide informa- tion, for example, through optical remote sensing imagery combined with deep learning to comprehensively recognize the surface geological environment [63–65], or use image segmentation technology for the segmentation and data mining of planar raster map data to expand the knowledge map in the field of landslides, improve spatial correlation and attribute similarity, and mine more implicit relationships so as to provide a more complete system of feature factors for landslide recognition [66,67]. The aim is to provide a more complete feature factor system for landslide identification.\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nLandslide, as a major geological disaster, is of great significance to timely and accu- rately delineate landslide-prone areas for disaster defense and policy formulation. This research aims to construct a feature factor selection model under a priori knowledge, com- bined with a knowledge discovery algorithm to mine the highly correlated but underuti- lized factors in historical landslide disasters and construct a feature factor recommendation model. With the selected TGA as a study case, we evaluated six machine learning al- gorithms, and selected the better-performing random forest model for hyper-parameter optimization, constructing an interpretable landslide susceptibility assessment model.\n\nIn this study, the UIE model is used and fine-tuned with a small amount of labeled data to construct mapping relationships to realize the knowledge graph of landslide disaster for text data. The obtained knowledge graph contains 2167 entities and 2352 relationships."

      "content": "The obtained knowledge graph contains 2167 entities and 2352 relationships. Based on the similarity calculation and knowledge discovery of the knowledge graph, this paper constructs a feature combination containing relevant disaster factors. With six ML models, it is effectively proved that the inclusion of landslide disaster associated factors contributes to the optimization of classification results. The RF accuracy after combining the optimal feature combination and hyper-parameter optimization reaches 87.20%, indicating that the model constructed in this paper has high credibility. The spatial distribution of susceptibility shows that the high-risk areas of TGA are located in the western and eastern edge areas. Quantitative analysis of the relationship between the characteristic factors and the probability of landslide occurrence shows that the probability of landslides occurring is smaller as the Mudslide distance and Collapse distance increase; and as the DEM, SLOPE, Fault Density, Collapse density increase with the value, the probability of landslide susceptibility first increases and then decreases. The Elevation Coefficient of Variation and River Density increase with the value as the probability of landslide susceptibility increases sharply.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Q.W. and Q.Q.; methodology, Q.W., Z.X. and Q.Q.; validation, M.T.; formal analysis, J.C. and L.T.; writing—original draft preparation, Q.W. and Y.Z.; writing—review and editing, M.T., Q.Q. and L.T.; supervision, J.C.; funding acquisition, Q.Q.

This study presents a framework using convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network to produce short- (1, 3, and 7 days ahead) and mid-term (14 and 30 days ahead) forecasts of SM at surface (0–10 cm) and subsurface (10–40 and 40–100 cm) soil layers across the contiguous U.S. The model was trained with five-year period (2018–2022) datasets including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) level 3 ancillary covariables, North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2) SM prod-uct, shortwave infrared reflectance from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and terrain features (e.g., elevation, slope, curvature), as well as soil texture and bulk density maps from the Soil Landscape of the United States (SOLUS100) database. To develop and evaluate the model, the dataset was divided into three subsets: training (Jan-uary 2018–January 2021), validation (2021), and testing (2022). The outputs were validated with observed in situ data from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and the United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN) soil moisture networks. The results indicated that the accuracy of SM forecasts decreased with increasing lead time, particularly in the surface (0–10 cm) and subsurface (10–40 cm) layers, where strong fluctuations driven by rainfall variability and evapotranspiration fluxes introduced greater uncertainty."

Forecast accuracy was highest in coarse-textured soils, followed by medium- and fine-textured soils, likely because the greater penetration depth of microwave obser-vations improves SM retrieval in sandy soils. Among land cover types, performance was strongest in grasslands and savannas and weakest in dense forests and shrublands, where dense vegetation attenuates the microwave signal and reduces SM estimation accuracy.

Accurate and timely SM information is essential for a wide range of applications at local to global scales, including weather forecasting [3], early warning systems for droughts and floods [4,5], landslide prediction [6], and wildfire risk assessment [7]. SM regulates key land surface fluxes such as evaporation, infiltration, runoff, and groundwater recharge. In particular, root zone SM (typically within the top 0-100 cm) is critical for coupling these surface and subsurface processes, which makes it a key variable for hydrological modeling and water resources management [1]. Despite its importance, accurate nowcasts (short-term forecast) and forecasts (mid- and long-term forecast) of surface and subsurface SM at regional to continental scales remain a challenge, mainly due to the limitations of current measurement and monitoring techniques.\n\nWhile in situ monitoring networks provide high-quality multi-depth SM data, they are spatially sparse and only represent point-scale observations [8], which limits their application for large-scale monitoring. To overcome these limitations, satellite-based remote sensing (RS) has become a widely used method for monitoring SM. Among different RS techniques, L-band microwave observations (1-2 GHz) have shown strong sensitivity to soil dielectric properties and the ability to penetrate moderate vegetation cover, which makes them suitable for large-scale SM estimation [9]. The Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission, launched by NASA in 2015, is currently a prime example for satellite-based SM monitoring, which provides surface SM (0-5 cm) at spatial resolutions of 9 and 36 km (Level 3 product, L3) with revisit times of 2-3 days and root zone SM (0-100 cm) through data assimilation (level 4 product, L4) at 9 km resolution and 3 h intervals [10-12].\n\nAlthough SMAP SM products represent a significant advancement, they include several limitations. As pointed out, the L3 product is limited to surface SM and does not capture subsurface conditions. The L4 product addresses this by assimilating brightness temperature data into a land surface model to estimate root zone SM."

The L4 product addresses this by assimilating brightness temperature data into a land surface model to estimate root zone SM. However, it provides only a depth-averaged SM value for the 0-100 cm soil profile. This averaging does not capture SM variability within the soil profile caused by processes such as surface evaporation, root water uptake, and deep percolation. Moreover, L3 and L4 products are limited by a data latency of about 2 days before public release, which limits their usefulness for real-time (nowcasting) and future (forecasting) predictive applications. Knowledge of the distribution of SM within the soil profile is particularly important for vadose zone hydrology and agricultural decision-making. For example, root distribution models for mixed cropping systems show that approximately 41% of root biomass occurs between 7 and 28 cm depth, with lesser density in shallower and deeper layers [13]. Thus, multi-depth SM nowcasts and forecasts that resolve SM variations within the soil profile are important for improving hydrologic modeling, optimizing irrigation scheduling, and forecasting extreme weather events.\n\nRecent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques combined with increased computational power (e.g., GPUs) and the growing availability of long-term ground and RS observations have opened new opportunities for SM forecasting. These methods have demonstrated strong potential to overcome the limitations of traditional in situ and single-sensor techniques by exploiting nonlinear relationships among climatic, soil, and vegetation variables. DL models can learn complex nonlinear relationships between SM and its diverse drivers and controlling variables [14-17]. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used to identify spatial patterns in variables such as SM, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and crop yield [18-21]. However, CNNs alone are not suitable for modeling temporal variations, which limits their applications for SM forecasting. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Long"

However, LSTM models cannot effectively capture spatial variability, which is important for identifying SM distribution across scales.\n\nTo overcome this, Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) have been introduced as a hybrid method that integrates CNN-based spatial learning with LSTM-based temporal modeling to allow for simultaneous extraction of spatiotemporal features [24-26]. This integration shows interest in predicting hydrologic covariables such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and SM. Nevertheless, key challenges remain, including the coarse resolution of many satellite products, difficulties in retrieving subsurface moisture, and the limited transferability of models across diverse regions. Emerging opportunities such as hybrid ML models, deep learning architectures (e.g., CNN-RNN, ConvLSTM), and transfer learning provide promising pathways to improve prediction accuracy and scalability [27]. Studies have demonstrated that integrating SM simulations from the North America Land Data Assimilation Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) with SM products from satellite data can improve the accuracy of outputs by leveraging both physical understanding and observational data [28]. For example, Ahmed et al. [16] developed a CNN-RNN model to forecast surface SM at multiple lead times using a combination of satellite, model, and climate variables in Australia. However, their approach focused only on surface SM and a relatively homogeneous landscape, which limits its generalization. Despite these advances, a critical knowledge gap persists in reliably forecasting root-zone SM for multiple lead times, which this study aims to address.\n\nThis study presents a framework for short- (1-, 3-, and 7-day lead times) and mid-term (14- and 30-day lead times) forecasting of surface and subsurface SM across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) using a ConvLSTM model. The model integrates a range of multi-source multi-scale predictors including SMAP surface SM and ancillary data, NLDAS-2 SM, MODIS surface reflectance, terrain attributes, and soil physical properties from the Soils of the Landscapes of the U.S. (SOLUS100) digital soil maps."

NLDAS-2 Soil Moisture\n\nAs an important input for model training, we used SM data from NLDAS-2 based on Noah land surface model (LSM), which provides SM at depth intervals of 0-10 cm, 10-40 cm, and 40-100 cm with spatial resolution of 0.125° (~12 km). Among the LSMs included in NLDAS-2, the Noah model has shown the best agreement with in situ observations (Table 3 in [29]). Hourly SM data were aggregated to daily values for all three layers across CONUS from January 2018 to December 2022 using NASA's Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) portal.\n\n2.1.2. SMAP Soil Moisture and Ancillary Datasets\n\nThe SMAP L3 product provides surface (0-5 cm) SM retrievals from the passive microwave brightness temperature using the tau-omega radiative transfer model. These estimates are available for both descending (6:00 AM) and ascending (6:00 PM) satellite overpasses with 2-3 days revisit cycle [10]."

Since the performance of these products varies with surface conditions [30], we evaluated all SMAP SM products in comparison with NLDAS-2 SM data.\n\nThe results showed that the DCA product provides the best temporal correlation across various land cover types, while NLDAS-2 SM yielded lower RMSE values (Table 1). Based on this evaluation, we selected the SMAP DCA SM product (SPL3SMP_E, version 5) as a benchmark to train the model for temporal patterns, while the NLDAS-2 SM was used to improve the accuracy of the training in capturing the absolute magnitude of SM (see Equation (8)).

Soil Physical Properties, Terrain Attributes and Land Cover Data\n\nBecause soil physical properties, as relatively static predictors, control SM dynamics mostly at local scale, we used the Soil Landscapes of the United States (SOLUS100) digital soil maps produced by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) [33]. These maps provide 100 m resolution gridded data for twenty soil properties derived using hybrid digital soil mapping techniques through combining laboratory measurements, expert-classified field descriptions, and statistically derived estimates from soil survey databases. From this dataset, we extracted key physical properties including texture (sand, silt, and clay content) and bulk density at three representative depths of 5, 30, and 60 cm. SOLUS100 dataset provide these specific depths as representative of the center of a soil layer, which correspond to the NLDAS-2 SM layers of 0-10, 10-40, and 40-100 cm, respectively.\n\nTo assess the effect of terrain characteristics on SM dynamics, we used elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (Version 4), which provides 90 m resolution elevation data across CONUS. From this DEM, we derived several terrain parameters including slope degree, aspect, flow accumulation, and curvature [34], which are known to affect soil moisture distribution, especially at topsoil [35]. Previous studies have indicated that surface reflectance in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) range is a useful predictor of SM dynamics [36]. We included transformed SWIR reflectance (T-SWIR) as a model input, as studies have shown that it is physically and strongly linked to both soil moisture [36] and evapotranspiration [37], hence for this reason, direct incorporation of the MODIS evapotranspiration product was not undertaken in this study. We obtained SWIR band 7 reflectance images from the MODIS Aqua and Terra reflectance products (MOD09GA and MYD09GA). These products provide atmospherically corrected surface reflectance at 500 m spatial and daily temporal resolution. The SWIR reflectance was transformed into a reflectance index due to its strong linear correlation with soil moisture content [36]. In addition, incorporating land cover information can improve model training for reliable soil moisture projection."

For this, we used MODIS-based land cover type product (MCD12Q1, Version 6.1) [38] from Aqua and Terra satellites, which provides 500 m resolution classification of land cover into 17 distinct classes. The details of these land cover categories and their spatial distribution across the study area are illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n2.2. Data Preparation and Harmonization\n\nTo prepare the dataset for analysis, all predictors were resampled to 9 km pixel size to match the SMAP L3 SM grid and reprojected to a consistent coordinate system using the Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid version 2.0 (EASE-Grid 2.0). The bicubic interpolation method was applied to disaggregate coarse resolution data (e.g., NLDAS-2 and GPM), while the fine resolution variables were aggregated using pixel averaging within 9 km grid cells. This method aligns with our previous study [39] and is consistent with other studies that used integrating multi-source, multi-scale datasets for large-scale environmental mod- eling [40]. To address temporal inconsistency and fill data gaps, we employed a continuous recurrent unit (CRU)-based temporal imputation method [41] to generate continuous daily data. Before model training, the covariates were standardized (îst.) using z-score normal- ization, i.e., st. = (x – μ)/σ, where x is the original value, u is the mean value, and o is the standard deviation. Finally, all processed covariates were harmonized and stored in HDF5 format to streamline data ingestion in TensorFlow 2.6. The dataset was split into training (January 2018-January 2021), validation (the year 2021), and test (the year 2022) sets. In time series forecasting, splitting the data sequentially by time rather than spatial location is preferable, as it ensures that future predictions are evaluated against truly unseen periods, thereby providing a more realistic measure of the model's generalization capability."

Model Theory\n\nTo provide short- and mid-term SM forecasts, we employed convolutional long short- term memory (ConvLSTM) network by coupling CNN and LSTM. This integration allows the model to effectively lean spatial patterns and long-term temporal dependencies between SM and the predictors that control SM dynamics. LSTM is designed to learn temporal dependencies in sequential data due to their memory cells and gating mechanisms. Each LSTM unit contains a cell state that carries information across time steps and is regulated by three gates: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. The forget gate discards useless information from the previous state, the input gate incorporates new relevant information, and the output gate determines what information is passed on the next time step. This structure allows LSTMs to model long-term dependencies, which is essential for time series forecasting tasks such as SM prediction. The ConvLSTM uses this by incorporating convolutional operations into the LSTM architecture, which allows it to process spatiotemporal data more effectively [24]. Unlike traditional LSTM models that use fully connected layers, ConvLSTM applies convolutional operations in both the input- to-state and state-to-state transitions. This means that the future state of a cell depends not only on its own past state and inputs but also on those of its spatial neighbors. As a result, ConvLSTM can learn both spatial correlations and temporal dynamics, which makes it suitable for gridded data. In our implementation, the ConvLSTM network uses three-dimensional input tensors that represent spatial and vertical dimensions (i.e., latitude, longitude, and soil depth). This allows the model to capture dependencies both across the land surface and among different soil layers. The ConvLSTM architecture is mathematically defined by Equations (1)-(7) [24]."

Model Architecture and Computational Setup\n\nThe architecture of the ConvLSTM model used in this study integrates convolutional operations directly within the LSTM units. Unlike traditional sequential models that apply CNN layers before LSTM layers (CNN-LSTM), the ConvLSTM architecture embeds convolutional filters within the internal gates of the LSTM itself. This design allows the model to learn both spatial features and temporal dependencies simultaneously, which is particularly effective for spatiotemporal forecasting of SM. Moreover, the model analyzes input data as three-dimensional tensors, which allows for capturing SM dynamics in space and in time and at different soil depths. Figure 2 displays an overview of the model workflow. Each input sample consists of a 3-day sequence of predictor variables extracted from an 8 × 8 spatial grid (~72 × 72 km area) using a stride of 2 to provide full spatial coverage across CONUS. While longer sequences could potentially improve predictive performance, they were avoided in this study to reduce computational costs and minimize the risk of overfitting, as pointed out in previous studies [26,44]. The final input tensor has the shape 'samples, 8, 8, 3, 17', where 8 × 8 represents the window size, 3 is the temporal look-back window (days), and 17 is the number of predictors used (see Table 2). The ConvLSTM network consists of eight hidden layers with filter sizes increasing progressively (4, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256), followed by a fully connected output layer. Dropout layers were included between certain hidden layers to reduce overfitting by randomly deactivating a fraction of neurons during training. This patch-based input approach not only reduces memory requirements but also allows the model to learn localized fine-scale patterns across the spatial domain. Due to the large spatiotemporal extent of the dataset (five years of daily data across CONUS), automated hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization were computationally impractical. Instead, a manual tuning strategy was used, in which key hyperparameters including the number of layers, filter sizes, dropout rates, and learning rates were iteratively tried within their typical ranges and modified based on model performance to obtain an optimal configuration."

Comparable results were also obtained using USCRN data across all three soil layers scenarios (Table 5). The availability of SOLUS soil products, which provide high-resolution (100 m) maps of basic soil properties at multiple depths is advantageous for improving SM forecasts and downscaling SM products [50]. In this study, although the SOLUS-based soil texture maps (sand, silt and clay) were resampled from 100 m to 9 km grid, they still played an important role in improving SM forecasting at various depths.\n\nComparing the results from S2 and S3 indicates that including additional predictors does not necessarily improve model performance. This aligns with findings from prior studies, where reducing the number of input features through selection techniques like Lasso regularization improved model accuracy and generalization [51,52]. Interestingly, the inclusion of precipitation data in S3 did not improve the model performance. Although precipitation is the primary source of water input to the soil, its short-term signal does not always translate directly into measurable changes in soil moisture, particularly in deeper layers. The lag introduced by infiltration and percolation process often delays the response of SM to precipitation events [53]. As a potential improvement, future work could explore incorporating precipitation lag effects more explicitly, for example, by replacing daily precipitation inputs with aggregated 7-day or 14-day averages, as suggested by Heuvelink et al. [54]. Moreover, other dominant controls such as evapotranspiration, soil hydraulic properties, vegetation cover, and antecedent moisture conditions may exert stronger influences on SM dynamics that same-day precipitation. Another contributing factor may be the scale mismatch, as precipitation datasets typically have coarser spatial resolution and higher uncertainty compared to SM and other predictors. Consistent with this observation, Karthikeyan and Mishra [55] reported that precipitation contributed least to SM prediction across all depths in feature importance analysis. Given that Scenario 2 produced more accurate short-term forecasts for both surface and subsurface layers, we relied on Scenario 2 to present the ConvLSTM model results in the following sections.\n\n## 3.2."

      "content": "Given that Scenario 2 produced more accurate short-term forecasts for both surface and subsurface layers, we relied on Scenario 2 to present the ConvLSTM model results in the following sections.\n\n## 3.2. Short- and Mid-Term Surface and Subsurface SM Forecasts\n\nBuilding upon the results that the S2 scenario provided the highest accuracy for 1-day forecasts at the three soil layers for SCAN and USCRN, we further evaluated its performance for short- (1 and 7 days) and mid-term (14 and 30 days) forecast lead times. Figure 3 depicts the evaluation of S2 scenario forecasts using in situ observations from SCAN sites for the year 2022. Because the model performance using USCRN data yielded error metrics comparable to those from SCAN sites, the detailed results from USCRN are provided separately in Figure A1 (Appendix A). Results indicated that the accuracy of SM forecast decreased with increasing lead time across all depths. This decline was most pronounced in the surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-40 cm) layers, where SM is highly dynamic due to rapid responses to rainfall inputs and evapotranspiration losses. These processes introduce large short-time fluctuations, making predictions at longer lead times more uncertain. The scatterplots show that the ConvLSTM model maintains relatively high accuracy across all three soil layers with the best accuracy at 1-day lead time. For example, at the surface layer (0-10 cm), the model achieves an ubRMSE of 0.086 cm³ cm-3 and R of 0.73 for 1-day lead time. The accuracy declined slightly in 7 days with ubRMSE of 0.090 cm³ cm³ and R of 0.71. Similar trends were observed for the subsurface layers. At 10-40 cm, the ubRMSE increased from 0.089 (1-day) to 0.093 cm³ cm³ (30-day) and R decreased from 0.70 (1-day) to 0.66 (30-day)."

Evaluation of short- (1 and 7 days) and mid-term (14 and 30 days) SM forecasts for surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-40 cm and 40-100 cm) soil layers using in situ data from 'SCAN' sites in 2022 (test set). The error metrics were calculated by comparing the model results vs. in situ values at depths of 5 cm (corresponding to 0-10 cm), 20 cm (corresponding to 10-40 cm), and 50 cm (corresponding to 40-100 cm). RMSE: Root Mean Square Error; R: Correlation Coefficient; MBE: Mean Bias Error; ubRMSE: unbiased Root Mean Square Error.\n\nA systematic bias was observed across depths and lead times, where the model tended to over-forecast SM under dry conditions (~less than 0.10 cm³ cm³) and under-forecast under wet conditions (~higher than 0.35 cm³ cm³). This pattern can be attributed to several factors. First, spatial mismatches arise when comparing gridded forecasts (9 km pixel size) to point-scale in situ values [1]. Second, vertical mismatches occur because the model provides average SM over thick layers (e.g., 0-10 cm), whereas in situ sensors provide data at more discrete depths (e.g., 5, 20, and 50 cm), which may not fully capture the entire modeled layer. Third, the ConvLSTM architecture uses a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function for the memory cells and a sigmoid function for gate operations. While this setup ensures physically consistent outputs (e.g., preventing negative values), it may also compress extreme values toward the mean, which can lead to under-forecasting of SM in high moisture conditions [56]. Moreover, considering the 9 km spatial resolution of the forecasts, extremely dry or wet conditions are unlikely to be uniformly present across the entire grid cell. Therefore, the model's relatively smooth responses reflect not only a limitation of the architecture but also the inherent physical averaging effects at coarser resolutions."

As shown in Figure 4, for the 0–10 cm layer, both short- and mid-term forecasts showed median ubRMSE and bias values of 0.05 cm³ cm⁻³ and 0.01 cm³ cm⁻³, respectively. Unsurprisingly, the R values declined with increasing the forecast lead time, ranging from 0.27 (30-day) to 0.61 (1-day). The largest ubRMSE and bias values were observed in the Mideast and Southeast regions, although the corresponding R values remained relatively high. This finding is consistent with Karthikeyan and Mishra ([55], Figure 5) who reported that at 5 cm and 10 cm depths, ubRMSE was high (~0.06 cm³ cm⁻³) while correlation was also strong (~0.8). Such behavior can be attributed to pronounced soil moisture fluctuations in these regions (see Figure 6 in [57]). As a result, the model was able to capture the overall temporal pattern of soil moisture dynamics (e.g., wet and dry seasons) but less accurately estimated the exact magnitudes. In contrast, the Northeast showed lower R values and higher ubRMSE values, likely due to the effect of dense vegetation which interferes with SMAP brightness temperature observations, and the narrower range of SM variations which weaken the R values. In addition, frequent freeze–thaw cycles and seasonal snowpack in the northeast reduce temporal data quality and increase ubRMSE.\n\n|         | Pearson Correlation (R) | ubRMSE (cm³cm-3) | Bias (cm³ cm³) |\n| ------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |\n| (1 day) | &#xA;0.61±0.2&#xA;      |                  |                |\n\n\n</td>\n<td>\n| ![](image3.png) |\n| --------------- |\n| 0.05 +0.02      |\n| ![](image4.png) |"

([58], Figure 1) who used an LSTM model to assimilate SMAP level 3 data for SM mapping. Another example is the work by Karthikeyan and Mishra ([55], Figure 5) in which they generated 1 km SM maps across the U.S. In terms of ubRMSE and R values, the best SM forecasts were obtained in the Southwest and parts of the West, where sparse vegetation and lower vegetation water content reduce signal interference. Notably, SM forecast errors were particularly low at stations located in Utah state. Unlike SMAP SM products, which often show low accuracy in this region due to the influence of snowpack and complex mountainous terrain [59], the ConvLSTM model demonstrated high accuracy in both R and ubRMSE values. This improved performance may be attributed to integrating the strengths of the two different SM products from the physics-based SMAP L3 (DCA), which uses surface observations, and a process-based model (NLDAS-2), which considers hydrological processes. In addition, in the northeastern CONUS, the forecast performance at the surface layer (0–10 cm) was relatively poor, with correlation values (R) ranging from −0.3 to 0.2 and ubRMSE values ranging from 0.07 to 0.11 cm³ cm⁻³ (Figure 4). This reduced accuracy can be attributed to the prevailing cold and humid continental climate (Dfa/Dfb classes in the Köppen classification, Figure A2), where soil freezing is common during winter months. Frozen soils alter the dielectric properties sensed by satellites and strongly affect the dynamics of soil moisture, leading to discrepancies between modeled forecasts and in situ measurements. These freeze-thaw processes introduce nonlinear and abrupt changes that are challenging for data-driven models to capture, thereby reducing forecast skill in this region. For the surface layer (0–10 cm), nearly 50% of the evaluated SM stations (90 sites) achieved ubRMSE values below the SMAP accuracy threshold of 0.04 cm³ cm⁻³ [47] for both short- and mid-term SM forecasts.\n\nResults for the subsurface layers (10–40 cm and 40–100 cm) followed similar trends to the surface layer."

Overall, the accuracy of SM forecasts, shown by R, ubRMSE and bias, decreases with increasing forecast lead time, which is in accordance with previous studies [16]. When examined across land cover types, the ConvLSTM model generally performed best in grasslands and savannas, where SM variability is more directly linked to precipitation and evapotranspiration cycles, resulting in higher correlation coefficients (R), but sometimes greater bias and ubRMSE. In contrast, forests and shrublands exhibited lower accuracy, likely due to the buffering effect of dense vegetation and complex canopy-soil interactions, which obscure direct precipitation-soil moisture relationships. Croplands and permanent water bodies showed intermediate errors, with higher variability across SCAN sites.

Medium-textured soils showed intermediate performance, while fine-textured soils exhibited the greatest challenges, particularly at deeper layers (40-100 cm), where slower infiltration and stronger retention effects delay the SM responses, reducing forecast skill over longer lead times. In terms of ubRMSE values at the surface layer (0-10 cm), coarse-textured soils showed the lowest errors for all lead times, followed by medium- and fine-textured soils. However, the ranking was different for R, where medium-textured soils outperformed fine- and coarse-textured soils. These differences may be partly explained by soil hydraulic properties, i.e., sandy soils have high infiltration capacity and rapid percolation rates, leading to rapid SM responses to rainfall but also faster drying, which can reduce temporal correlation. Conversely, fine-textured soils with low infiltration capacity can generate surface runoff during high precipitation rates, delaying water movement into deeper layers and dampening SM variability, thereby affecting R and ubRMSE. Additionally, the rapid SM fluctuations in sandy soils may increase the effective sensing depth of SMAP [62,63], affecting forecast performance patterns in various textures. The median bias was generally near zero across all soil textures and soil layers; however, slightly larger deviations were noted in the deeper layers for medium and fine-textured soils. These biases likely reflect challenges in capturing infiltration and redistribution processes in these two major soil textural classes where water moves slowly within the soil profile which slows down wetting-drying cycles. Similar performance patterns were observed using USCRN SM observations, as shown in Figure A4 (Appendix A).\n\n0-10 cm\n10-40 cm\n40-100 cm\n\nR\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nCoarse Tex\nMedium Tex.\nFine Tex.\nCoarse Tex.\nMedium Tex.\nFine Tex.\nCoarse Tex\nMedium Tex.\nFine Tex.\n\nMBE or Bias (cm³ cm³)\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nCoarse Tex\nMedium Tex\nFine Tex\nCoarse Tex.\nMedium Tex.\nFine Tex.\nCoarse Tex.\nMedium Tex.\nFine Tex.\n\nubRMSE (cm³ cm³)\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nCoarse Tex.\nMedium Tex.\nFine Tex.\nCoarse Tex.\nMedium Tex.\nFine Tex.\nCoarse Tex.\nMedium Tex.\nFine Tex."

Short- and Mid-Term SM Forecast Maps\n\nTo evaluate the performance of ConvLSTM model under the S2 scenario for producing spatiotemporal SM maps, we produced forecast maps for 10 April 2022 across three soil layers with lead times of 1, 7, and 30 days (Figure 9). These forecasted maps were visually compared with NLDAS-2 SM product for the corresponding layers, along with underlying soil texture data from the SOLUS100 digital soil maps. Across all three layers, the model forecasts closely matched the spatial patterns observed in the NLDAS-2 maps. The model successfully captured drier SM distributions in sandy regions and higher moisture levels in finer-textured soils, such as those found in the Midwest and Southeast. Notably, areas dominated by sandy soils, like Nebraska, showed lower SM values in both the forecasts and NLDAS-2, while clay- or silty-rich regions, like the lower Mississippi basin, showed higher moisture retention [49,59]. This strong spatial correspondence demonstrates the ability of the ConvLSTM model to reflect the effect of soil texture on water retention, storage, and infiltration. As the forecast lead time increases from 1 to 30 days, a gradual loss of fine-scale spatial detail becomes evident, especially in deeper soil layers, which indicates growing uncertainty with longer lead times. Nevertheless, even at 30-day lead time, the forecasts show general spatial agreement with the NLDAS-2 product, especially in subsurface layers."

Summary and Conclusions\n\nAccurate real-time soil moisture (SM) information is essential for a wide range of Earth and environmental science applications. This study presents a deep learning framework for forecasting SM at short- (1, 3, and 7 days) and mid-term (14 and 30 days) time scales for surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-40 cm and 40-100 cm) layers across the contiguous U.S. The model integrates multiple data sources including SMAP L3 SM and its ancillary variables (e.g., brightness temperature, surface temperature), NLDAS-2 SM products, SOLUS100 soil property maps, MODIS observations, terrain attributes, precipitation, and upper-layer SM information. The forecasting framework combines convolutional neural network and long short-term memory networks trained with multi-year datasets. This"

We evaluated three scenarios with different combinations of\ninput features. The produced SM forecasts at multiple soil layers were evaluated with\nin situ observations from SCAN and USCRN, which covered various land cover and\nsoil types.\n\nThe results indicate that the accuracy of SM forecasts declines with increasing lead\ntime. For surface SM, the median ubRMSE remained below 0.06 cm³ cm⁻³. Including\nSOLUS100-based soil physical properties and upper-layer SM as an additional predictor\nimproved subsurface forecasts. The median R values were nearly 0.61 (surface) and 0.60\n(10–40 cm), with median ubRMSE less than 0.045 cm³ cm⁻³. Integrating SMAP L3 (dual-\nchannel algorithm) data with NLDAS-2 SM products yielded SM forecasts that met the\nSMAP accuracy target (ubRMSE ~0.04 cm³ cm⁻³) at more than half of the SCAN sites.\nFor lead times of 1 to 30 days, median ubRMSE values were below 0.06 cm³ cm⁻³ with R\nvalues ranging from 0.19 (30-day) to around 0.66 (1-day). The accuracy varied by land cover\ntype, where grasslands and savannas yielded the best accuracy, while dense forests and\nshrublands reduced the accuracy due to vegetation attenuation and complex hydrological\nprocesses. The soil texture also affected the accuracy of SM forecasts, with coarse-textured\nsoils showing the lowest ubRMSE for all lead times, followed by medium and fine textures.\nForecast errors tended to overestimate in dry and underestimate in wet extremes, likely\ndue to grid-to-point scale mismatches and differences between depth-averaged model\noutputs vs. point-based observations. The forecast maps captured spatial patterns similar\nto NLDAS-2 SM and showed consistent patterns with soil texture even at the 30-day lead\ntime, which indicates the ability of the model to identify spatial patterns of SM even at a\nlarge scale.\n\nOne limitation of the current study is that in situ soil moisture observations were not\ndirectly included in the training phase."

Determining erosion potential of a harvest site, considering different harvest categories, requires accurate segmentation of each category. In this study, we encompassed 20 harvest sites in the southeastern United States and utilized high-resolution imagery from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), geographic information system (GIS) data, and deep learning models to segment various harvest categories within each site and estimate soil erosion potential. Site data used to predict erosion included rainfall and runoff erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), slope-length factor (L), slope-steepness factor (S), cover and management factor (C), and support practice factor (P). Six models based on U-Net, Deeplab V3, and PSPNet architectures, utilizing ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 backbones, were trained and evaluated for their accuracy in segmenting harvest categories. The model trained with Deeplab V3 architecture and ResNet-34 backbone demonstrated superior precision, recall, and F1 values compared to the others and was selected for segmenting the orthomosaic maps of the harvest sites into different harvest categories. Subsequently, using the classified orthomosaic and field-based data, a CP raster layer of each harvest site was prepared."

Parajuli et al.\nRemote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment 37 (2025) 101498\nand require the use of heavy machinery, which is similar to other regions of the US with the use of heavy machinery for harvesting timber (Hiesl and Benjamin, 2013; Murray et al., 2023; Parajuli, 2021; Soman et al., 2020). When best management practices (BMPs) are not properly implemented, these activities can negatively impact forest soil (Cristan et al., 2016; Hawks et al., 2022; Parajuli et al., 2024). Although soil erosion is a natural phenomenon, timber harvesting without proper BMP implementation can accelerate soil erosion and sedimentation, leading to degraded water quality. Harvesting activities combined with rainfall and site characteristics can cause varying degrees of soil erosion and sedimentation, which can impair water quality by reducing stream depth, increasing turbidity, elevating nutrient pollution, and disrupting aquatic habitats (Binkley and Brown, 1993; Cristan et al., 2016; Hawks et al., 2022). Erosion processes exhibit significant temporal and spatial dynamics, making it crucial to understand and map these processes in detail over time and space (Samarin et al., 2020; Shruthi et al., 2015). It is essential to monitor soil erosion on timber harvests to understand the current soil erosion status and prepare effective management plans. By estimating soil erosion potential and identifying critical areas immediately after harvesting, forest managers can better plan post-harvesting management activities and implement BMPs according to the site conditions.\n\nVarious methods can be used for estimating erosion, including conventional on-the-ground surveys (hereafter referred to as 'conventional survey') using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) forest handbook (hereafter referred to as 'USLE handbook'), remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches, Revised USLE 2 (RUSLE 2), and the web-based Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). Remote sensing and GIS, RUSLE 2, and WEPP tools are viable computer-based alternatives (Laflen et al., 1997; McCool et al., 2004).\n\nIn the US, soil erosion estimation began in the early 1900s.

      "content": "In the US, soil erosion estimation began in the early 1900s. In the 1940's, AW. Zingg introduced the first mathematical equation to estimate soil erosion losses (Cooper, 2011; Zingg, 1940). Walt Wischmeier and Dwight Smith introduced the USLE in 1965 and a revised version in 1978 which had improvements made to the variables and a westward expansion (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). Several research works have modified USLE's factors for local and regional conditions (Duarte et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024; Moody, 2020; Panagos et al., 2012; Pinson and AuBuchon, 2023; Renard and Freimund, 1994). Originally designed for agricultural purposes, USLE has been adapted to more accurately predict sheet and rill erosion on forest lands. It estimates erosion in areas where forest management activities or other operations expose soil to the erosive forces of rainfall and runoff (Renard, 1997; Renard and Freimund, 1994).\n\nConventional survey for soil erosion estimation can be time-intensive and labor-intensive, requiring meticulous fieldwork while navigating challenges like terrain, site wetness, and harvest site scale (Parajuli et al., 2024; Rijal et al., 2023). With the advancements in technology, integrating USLE with remote sensing and GIS is becoming popular for soil erosion estimation; offering enhanced estimation accuracy and spatial distribution at reasonable costs (Duarte et al., 2021; Moody, 2020; Rawat et al., 2016; Zerihun et al., 2018). It also provides visualization and faster analysis of erosion potential and allows simulation of large-scale studies using large amounts of data requiring a relatively short processing time (Blaszczynski, 2001). Parameters such as slope and aspect, derived from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) information, can be easily integrated with the USLE using GIS tools (Ganasri and Ramesh, 2016; Malinowski et al., 2023)."

However, these studies often treated entire forests as a single land use category, assigning a uniform value for forest areas. Harvested forests, however, include distinct categories such as forest roads, skid trails, loading decks, Streamside Management Zones (SMZs), and clear-cut areas (excluding roads, skid trails, loading decks, stream crossings, and SMZs). Each category has unique functions, operational needs, and varying rates of soil erosion due to different levels of disturbance (Barrett et al., 2016; Hawks et al., 2022). There is a need for research to develop a comprehensive framework integrating GIS, remote sensing, and USLE for harvest sites to account for varying erosion potentials of different harvest categories and provide more precise soil erosion assessments. Furthermore, information on CP values for each forest harvest category is not yet available for reference. Therefore, this study aims to document the CP values for various harvest categories across the study sites, providing valuable data to support future research and applications.\n\nIntegrating high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery with deep learning algorithms has demonstrated significant potential to reliably map, detect features, classify, and segment objects (Bouguettaya et al., 2022; Pearse et al., 2020).

For instance, a study by Jeppesen et al. (2019) used U-Net to detect clouds in optical satellite imagery in Denmark. Guo et al.

These deep learning techniques have revolutionized remote sensing, particularly in image classification, due to their ability to automate feature extraction and processing, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency in analyzing and interpreting complex imagery data (Ma et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2020). This advancement holds significant implications for fields such as geomorphology, hydrology, and environmental management, where detailed terrain models are crucial for watershed studies, erosion assessments, disaster risk analysis, and land use planning (Althoff et al., 2021; Khosravi et al., 2023; Ma and Mei, 2021). Although these techniques are commonly applied across various disciplines, their potential applications in segmenting a harvest site into different harvest categories and estimating soil erosion remain largely unexplored.\n\nThis research aims to assess soil erosion risk at timber harvest sites in the southeastern US by integrating USLE, high-resolution imagery, GIS, and deep learning algorithms.

Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Study area\n\nThe study covers 20 harvest sites located within the Coastal Plain region of the southeastern US: Alabama (n = 10), Georgia (n = 5),\nand Florida (n = 5) (Fig. 1). The most common harvest system available in this region is whole tree harvesting which includes using\nequipment such as a feller buncher, grapple skidder, and loader. The common type of soil in the Coastal Plain of Alabama is sandy\ntopsoil and clayey subsoil (McWilliams, 1992). Similarly, soil in the Coastal Plain of Georgia is predominantly sandy and loamy and\nFlorida features a wide range of soil types, from sandy soils in the uplands to more organic, peaty soils in lower-lying areas near water\nbodies (Watts and Collins, 2008). The selected sites were harvested within one year of field data collection in the summer of 2022.\nEach study site was surveyed using a commercially available, consumer-grade rotary-wing UAV, commonly used by foresters and\nloggers. This UAV was equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for precise navi-\ngation and control. It also featured an integrated Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) camera to capture georeferenced imagery and videos. The\nUAV surveys were pre-planned and conducted automatically via the Dronelink app (https://www.dronelink.com/).

For each site, rainfall data spanning the past 20 years were downloaded, representing data collected from rain gauge stations located in the respective counties. This data was used to estimate the spatial distribution of average annual precipitation (P) in the study area through the 'Kriging' method of interpolation (Ganasri and Ramesh, 2016). Using the raster calculator function in ArcGIS Pro 3.2 software, the mean annual precipitation was converted into a raster layer of R factor with a resolution of 0.5 m (meters). Renard and Freimund (1994) equations were used to derive the R factor from the average annual precipitation (mm), for the conterminous US. When average annual precipitation was less than 850 mm, Equation (2) was applied. For average annual precipitation greater than or equal to 850 mm, Equation (3) was applied:\n\nR=0.04830 P 1.610 Equation (2)\n\nR=587.8-1.219P +0.004105 P 2 Equation (3)\n\nWhere, R is rainfall and runoff erosivity factor (MJ-mm/ha-hr-yr.) and P is average annual precipitation (mm).\n\n2.2.2.

L and S factors\nDEM for each site was created using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data obtained from the United States Geological Survey's 3D Elevation Program (USGS 3DEP) and NOAA, which was accessed via OpenTopography. The data underwent initial processing in ArcGIS Pro 3.2 to classify ground points and the classified points were then used to generate DEMs at a 0.5 m resolution. These DEMs were then used to calculate slope-length and steepness using the Grid Cumulation (GC) method and the Maximum Downhill Slope (MDS) approach (Moody, 2020).\n\nUsing the GC method, slope-length was calculated based on the flow path length. High-resolution DEMs were utilized to provide precise slope angle estimates that accurately reflect the true topography of the landscape. During the analysis, DEM was evaluated using a pre-determined cut-off slope angle, which serves as the minimum slope angle necessary for erosion calculations. Flow direction over the landscape was derived from the DEM to identify the likely paths water would take as it descends the slopes, thus influencing erosion patterns. The flow direction data was then used to determine the non-cumulative slope-length, which is the distance water travels before reaching a steady state of flow. For regions with a zero slope angle (flat areas), a value of 0.1 was assigned to account for slight inclines that might not be detected by the DEM, recognizing that completely flat areas are rare (Moody, 2020). High points, where all flow paths originate, were identified as cells with no neighboring cells having corresponding flow directions, based on the D8 flow routing algorithm. Cumulative slope-length calculations were terminated when two flow paths converged (with the shorter path\n\n4"

The total slope-length, contributing to the 'L' factor, was calculated by cumulatively adding the slope-lengths from the identified starting points along the flow path. Adjustments were made for any slope-lengths exceeding the cutoff slope angle to refine the cumulative slope-length values.\n\nThe method for calculating the L factor is presented in Fig. 3.\n\nThe slope-steepness was determined using the MDS method (Dunn and Hickey, 1998; Hickey, 2000; Moody, 2020). The MDS method retains local variability and small-scale features as it does not use an average for calculating the slope. This method uses a 3x3 window but considers the center cell's elevation and its difference between one of the eight neighbors that give the maximum downhill slope. The consideration of only downhill neighbors for maximum value ensures that slope calculations are not overestimated (Dunn and Hickey, 1998; Hickey, 2000; Moody, 2020).\n\nThe slope value was calculated using Equation (4).\n\n<center>\n\n|                                  |\n| :-------------------------------: |\n|      Lidar point cloud data      |\n|                                  |\n| Classification of ground points  |\n|                                  |\n|         DEM generation          |\n|                                  |\n|   DEM and cutoff slope angle   |\n|                                  |\n\n</center>\n\n<center>\n\n|                                  |                               |                                  |\n| :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |\n|          Flow direction          |                               |    Maximum downhill slope angle   |\n|                                  |                               | Resetting zero values to 0.1 |\n|   Non-cumulative slope length   | Delineate beginning points and flat areas |                                  |\n|                                  |                               |                                  |\n| Cumulative downhill slope length |       Cutoff slope angle      |                                  |\n|                                  |                               |                                  |\n|            L factor            |                               |                                  |\n\n</center>\n\nFig. 3.

It measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly identified\npositive instances) out of all the instances that were predicted as positive by the model. Recall assesses the model's ability to suc-\ncessfully detect pixels belonging to the target class and represents the recall rate for positive samples (Equation (8)). The F1 score is a\nmetric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by balancing both precision and recall (Equation (9)). These metrics\nwere used to assess the performance of various models and identify the most suitable one for segmenting harvest categories.

Results\nAlthough we conducted the study across all 20 sites, including maps and images of all sites would make the document excessively long. Therefore, we present the maps and images from one harvest site as a representative example (Figs. 9-12). The final soil erosion map of all harvest sites can be found in the supplementary materials.\n\n## 3.1. Model comparison and selection\nDeepLab V3 with a ResNet-34 backbone was selected based on its superior performance in precision, recall, and F1-score (Tables 1 and 2).\n\n## 3.2. Harvest site example\n\n### 3.2.1. R, K, LS, and CP factors and soil erosion rate\nFor the example harvest site, the average annual rainfall was recorded at 1524 mm, resulting in a calculated rainfall erosivity factor (R) of 8264.22 MJ mm/ha-hr-yr.\n\nThe soil erodibility factor (K) map illustrates the spatial distribution of the K factor across the harvest site (Fig. 10). The K factor values, represented in different colors, indicate varying levels of soil susceptibility to erosion. Areas with higher values are more prone to erosion.\n\nFig. 11 (a) and (b) present the spatial distribution maps of the slope-length factor (L) and the slope-steepness factor (S) across the harvest site. The L factor values are color-coded, with higher values shown in shades of red and yellow and lower values in shades of green and blue (Fig. 11 a). Areas with higher L values correspond to longer slope lengths, which contribute to a greater potential for soil erosion.\n\nSimilar to the L factor map, the S factor values are color-coded, with higher values represented by red and yellow, and lower values by green and blue (Fig. 11 b). The S factor values indicate the steepness of the slopes, with steeper areas displaying higher values. These areas are more prone to soil erosion due to the increased gravitational force acting on soil particles.\n\nThe map showing the CP factor illustrates the spatial distribution of CP values across the harvest site (Fig. 12 a)."

      "content": "These areas are more prone to soil erosion due to the increased gravitational force acting on soil particles.\n\nThe map showing the CP factor illustrates the spatial distribution of CP values across the harvest site (Fig. 12 a). Evaluating the specific harvest site, the highest CP factor was observed in the forest roads, with an average value of 0.433. In contrast, SMZ exhibited the lowest CP factor, with an average value of 0.00003. Additionally, soil erosion rates (t/ha/yr) across different harvest categories within the example harvest site highlighted variations in soil erosion rates among the categories (Fig. 12 a). SMZ had the lowest erosion rate at 0.018 t/ha/yr, while roads had the highest erosion rate among all categories, at 23.70 t/ha/yr.\n\nSoil erosion rate maps illustrate the spatial distribution of soil erosion rates (t/ha/yr) across the harvest site (Fig. 12 b). Green areas indicate lower erosion rates and red areas indicate higher erosion rates. The average soil erosion rate across the harvest site example was 1.59 t/ha/yr.\n\n## 3.3. Average CP factor and soil erosion rates across harvest sites: documentation and comparisons\nThe analysis of average CP factor values across 20 harvest sites revealed that forest roads had the highest average CP factor at 0.268. In contrast, both the CC area with vegetation and SMZ exhibited the lowest average CP factor values, each at 0.001, reflecting minimal erosion susceptibility (Table 3).\n\nSoil erosion rates (t/ha/yr) were calculated across different harvest categories for all 20 harvest sites (Table 4). Roads exhibited the highest mean erosion rate at 13.17 t/ha/yr. Skid trails followed with a mean erosion rate of 4.12 t/ha/yr and loading decks had a mean erosion rate of 1.07 t/ha/yr."

Discussion\n\n4.1. New approach for forest soil erosion estimation\n\nTraditionally, soil erosion estimation has depended on field-based surveys, which, although very common, are field-intensive and time-consuming. Conventional field-based erosion estimation methods often rely on sample plots, where increasing the number of plots improves accuracy but can be field-intensive and time consuming, while fewer plots can lead to less accurate estimates. Additionally, human factors can impact field coverage and data accuracy. This may lead to an incomplete understanding of the ongoing erosion processes. This study demonstrated the use of deep learning techniques to segment harvest sites into various categories with high-resolution UAV imagery and to estimate potential soil erosion from each category using GIS software."

      "content": "This may lead to an incomplete understanding of the ongoing erosion processes. This study demonstrated the use of deep learning techniques to segment harvest sites into various categories with high-resolution UAV imagery and to estimate potential soil erosion from each category using GIS software.\n\nRecently, deep learning techniques have been extensively used in image segmentation. CNNs, in particular, have shown exceptional performance in remote sensing image classification tasks due to their hierarchical feature extraction capability, parameter sharing, and local connectivity mechanisms within convolutional layers (Boulila et al., 2021; O'shea & Nash, 2015). Previous studies combining GIS and remote sensing to estimate soil erosion have primarily focused on broad LULC classifications, often treating forested areas as a single entity. However, within timber harvest tracts, there are distinct categories, such as forest roads, skid trails, loading decks, SMZs, and CC areas. These categories have varying potentials for soil erosion, as demonstrated by field-based erosion studies (Fielding et al., 2022; Parajuli et al., 2024). High-resolution imagery is useful for differentiating these harvest categories, as aerial imagery with high spatial resolution allows for better observation of a harvest site, capturing fine details (Samarin et al., 2020). Such imagery can be collected from various platforms, including satellites and UAVs (Guirado et al., 2017; Rijal et al., 2023). While satellite imagery is useful, it comes with challenges, such as data unavailability for specific dates, the requirement for large coverage in tasking orders, and the limited resolution of freely accessible satellite data. In contrast, UAV-based imagery offers greater flexibility and higher precision in distinguishing different harvest categories. These days, UAVs are available in a variety of sizes, becoming more affordable, and increasingly efficient at collecting high-resolution imagery at specific time period (Rijal et al., 2023).\n\nIn our study, high-resolution imagery captured by a UAV enabled detailed analysis, allowing for the precise delineation of areas with high erosion potential. In soil erosion assessment, remote sensing-based semantic segmentation tasks are highly effective for mapping erosion across diverse terrains. Our findings showed that the DeepLab V3 model with a ResNet-34 backbone performed best to segment a harvest site into various harvesting categories, achieving an F1 score of over 90% in all harvest categories."

This approach offers enhanced maneuverability and flexibility, improving the ability to monitor and map erosion-prone areas while providing crucial data for informed decision-making and sustainable land management practices.\n\n4.2. Analysis of soil erosion rates across different harvest categories\n\nThis study revealed significant differences in soil erosion rates across various harvest categories. Our findings are consistent with different field-based studies, which have also identified the highest erosion rates on forest roads, skid trails, and loading decks, and the lowest rates in SMZs (Fielding et al., 2022; Garren et al., 2022; Parajuli et al., 2024). Roads, skid trails, and loading decks exhibited significantly higher erosion rates, as indicated by positive mean rank differences and significant p-values, compared to categories like CC areas with vegetation and CC areas without vegetation. The highest erosion rate from these categories can be attributed to intense topsoil disturbance, primarily due to the frequent passes of heavy machinery (Parajuli et al., 2022; Sakai et al., 2008). In contrast, SMZs consistently demonstrated the lowest erosion rates, characterized by negative mean rank differences and significant p-values relative to other harvest categories (Table 5). This lower erosion rate in SMZs is likely due to minimal soil disturbance and the protective vegetative cover typical of SMZs, which helps to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.\n\nThe lack of statistical significance between certain category pairs, such as CC areas with and without vegetation and skid trails compared to roads, suggests similar post-harvest characteristics and erosion rates between these categories. This similarity may result from comparable levels of soil disturbance and ground cover conditions. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating both the intensity and nature of harvesting activities when assessing their impact on soil erosion.\n\n4.3. Discrepancies between field-based and GIS-based erosion rates\n\nThis study, using a GIS-based method for erosion estimation, resulted an average erosion rate of 0.78 t/ha/year (min = 0.04, max =\n\n13"

In comparison, the field-based method resulted a lower average erosion rate of 0.33 t/ha/year (min = 0.04, max = 0.84, Table 6).\n\nThese differences between the erosion rates obtained from GIS-based and field-based methods can be attributed to variations in data sources, spatial resolution, and methodologies used for data collection. The higher spatial resolution and localized detail of GIS-based methods enable the capture of local variations in rainfall, soil properties, and topography, providing a more detailed information. The field-based method relies on R-factor values from USLE guidelines, determined by manually tracking the harvest site locations. Relying solely on the average annual rainfall index values from the USLE handbook may not reflect current conditions, as rainfall patterns can change over time (EPA, 2023). To obtain more reliable soil erosion estimates, it is essential to incorporate the latest rainfall data, ensuring a more accurate representation of recent trends and conditions.\n\nIn the field-based method, identifying different soil types and soil erodibility factor (K) values within a harvest site was challenging. As a result, a single K value was applied across the entire harvest site, assuming homogeneous soil characteristics. In contrast, the GIS-based method utilized detailed soil information from the SSURGO, accounting for the spatial variability of K values within a harvest site. Similarly, field-based methods commonly rely on manual tools, such as clinometers and measuring tapes, to calculate slope length and steepness, which are susceptible to human error. On the other hand, the GIS-based method incorporated LiDAR to generate DEM of the harvest site, enabling the use of advanced techniques like grid accumulation and maximum downhill slope methods for more accurate and detailed topographic analysis.\n\nThe field-based method remains a crucial approach for studying soil erosion, offering valuable on-site observations and ground-truthing. However, its reliability can be affected if an insufficient number of samples are collected, particularly in capturing site-\n\n14"

GIS and remote sensing are used to capture the entire site's topography, enabling a full-scale analysis rather than relying on small sample areas. This may also explain why the GIS-based method resulted different erosion rate as compared to field-based method. In addition to providing more accurate estimates, the GIS-based method also offers the advantage of creating detailed erosion maps for future reference. These maps can be used to develop long-term management strategies, allowing for the comparison of erosion rates across multiple harvest seasons. By providing a permanent record of soil erosion from a harvest site, GIS-based methods contribute to more effective decision-making and resource management over time. Overall, the methodology developed in this study highlights the advantages of using a holistic, technology-driven approach to improve the accuracy of erosion assessments.\n\n4.4. CP factor documentation\n\nWhen adapting the USLE model to local conditions, it is critical to gather accurate data on rainfall, soil erodibility, slope factors, and management practices. While information on rainfall, soil, and slope is widely accessible online, acquiring reliable CP factor data requires careful consideration due to its dependency on specific site characteristics, the extent and degree of disturbance within a harvest site, and other management conditions. CP factors, for instance, are influenced by numerous sub-factors, including previous management practices, bare soil, onsite storage, organic matter, steps, vegetative canopy, surface cover, surface roughness, and soil moisture (Dissmeyer and Foster, 1984). No online database currently provides CP factor information based on specific site or soil conditions, necessitating field surveys for data collection.\n\nSeveral past studies have generalized C and P values for entire forest areas. Ganasri and Ramesh (2016) assigned a C value of 0.003 and a P value of 1 for the entire forest area in western India. Similarly, Kim and Maidment (2014) applied these values uniformly across deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests in central Texas. These approaches can provide a broad understanding of soil erosion potential but may not fully provide the detailed information required to identify areas within a harvest site that are more susceptible to erosion. This study calculated and documented the CP values for each harvest category within a harvest site. Results from the study indicated that CP values varied across different harvest site categories."

      "content": "This study calculated and documented the CP values for each harvest category within a harvest site. Results from the study indicated that CP values varied across different harvest site categories. Forest roads exhibited the highest CP value at 0.268, indicating their high contribution to soil erosion potential due to the absence of canopy cover and the physical disturbances caused by road construction and use. In contrast, SMZs and CC with vegetation recorded the lowest CP values at 0.001, reflecting their minimal contribution to soil erosion risk by offering protective vegetation cover and enhanced stability. This highlights the effectiveness of vegetation and canopy cover in these areas as crucial measures for erosion control and highlights their role in mitigating soil erosion risks.\n\nThis study emphasizes the need to assign specific CP values for different harvest categories taking into account their unique characteristics and conditions. This adaptation is crucial as it addresses the heterogeneity within forest landscapes and reflects the actual management and soil disturbance levels. The CP values obtained in this research can be used in estimating soil erosion from a harvest site using remote sensing techniques in similar areas. Although this study was primarily focused on harvest sites located in the Coastal Plain region of the southeastern US, expanding this research to include different physiographic regions and states will greatly enhance the overall understanding and practical application of CP values. This documentation provides forest managers and re- searchers with a more efficient method for estimating soil erosion at forest harvest sites. It facilitates the implementation of soil conservation strategies and best management practices according to specific site conditions and soil characteristics.\n\n4.5. Challenges and future directions\n\nIn field-based forest soil erosion studies, stream crossings are often categorized separately. However, in our study, distinguishing stream crossings from SMZs was difficult because the imagery was captured from a top-down perspective, where overlapping canopy cover obscured the underlying features and their conditions, as also noted by Rijal et al. (2023). Hence, stream crossings were not classified as a separate category in this study. Differentiating features under dense canopy cover remains challenging and may demand imagery collected at different view settings. While this study provides an effective alternative approach to conventional soil erosion assessments, it faces challenges like the need for high-quality, high-resolution data, which poses logistical and financial constraints in large forest areas. Future research could explore using medium-resolution imagery combined with supplementary data sources, such as multispectral or hyperspectral data, to improve the segmentation and classification of harvest categories.\n\n5."

Conclusions\n\nIn this study, we integrated high-resolution imagery, deep learning, and GIS with the USLE model to analyze and visualize potential soil loss, demonstrating the practical application of these technologies in forest management. Utilizing the DeepLab V3 architecture with a ResNet-34 backbone, we achieved high performance in detecting and differentiating forest harvest site categories. Furthermore, our findings revealed significant variability in erosion rates, with forest roads and skid trails showing higher susceptibility to erosion.\n\nThis study documented average CP values for each harvest category to support GIS-based soil erosion estimation in the Coastal Plain region. Although this approach minimizes the need for extensive field collection of CP values, site-specific field data remain indispensable. Field measurements are critical for validating and calibrating GIS-based methods, ensuring their accuracy and reliability.\n\nThe techniques developed in this study to generate spatially detailed erosion risk maps can greatly improve decision-making for forest managers. By identifying high-risk areas, managers can prioritize erosion control measures, such as strategically planning harvesting techniques to minimize soil disturbance. Additionally, continuous monitoring of forest soil conditions using UAVs provides a valuable tool for assessing the effectiveness of management practices over time.
