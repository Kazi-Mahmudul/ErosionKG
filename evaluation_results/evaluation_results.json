      "ground_truth": "The guide for applying the 'Options by Context' approach to land restoration is structured as a five-step guide. The foundational 2019 Sinclair and Coe study, which describes the paradigm shift in agronomy, is published in volume 55 of Experimental Agriculture and covers the page range of 1–13.",

      "erosionkg_answer": "According to the provided references, the 'Options by Context' approach is mentioned in Source 4 (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206). The guide for applying this approach is described as having a five-step process, as mentioned in the same source (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206).\n\nThe 2019 Sinclair and Coe study that details this paradigm shift is cited in Source 4 (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206) with the reference \"Sinclair, F.; Coe, R. The Options by Context Approach: A Paradigm Shift in Agronomy. Exp. Agric. 2019, 55, 1–13.\" However, the specific volume and page range values for this study are Volume 55, pages 1-13 (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206). \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n- The guide for applying the 'Options by Context' approach has 5 steps (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206).\n- The specific volume and page range values for the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study are Volume 55, pages 1-13 (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206).",

The references provided do not mention a 2019 Sinclair and Coe study or explicitly outline steps for an 'Options by Context' approach in the context of land restoration and sustainable management as described in the question.\n\nHowever, reference 83 (Thomas, R.; Reed, M.; Clifton, K.; Appadurai, N.; Mills, A.; Zucca, C.; Kodsi, E.; Sircely, J.; Haddad, F.; Hagen, C.; et al. A Framework for Scaling Sustainable Land Management Options. Land Degrad. Dev. 2018, 29, 3272–3284.) discusses a framework for scaling sustainable land management options, which might imply a structured approach but does not specify the \"Options by Context\" method or the details requested.\n\nGiven the information available in the context, it's not possible to provide a precise answer to the question as it seems to refer to specific details (the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study and the 'Options by Context' approach) that are not covered in the provided references.",
