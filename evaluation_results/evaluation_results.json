      "question": "According to the references provided for land restoration and sustainable management, how many steps are defined in the guide for applying the 'Options by Context' approach, and what are the specific volume and page range values for the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study that details this paradigm shift?",
      "ground_truth": "The guide for applying the 'Options by Context' approach to land restoration is structured as a five-step guide. The foundational 2019 Sinclair and Coe study, which describes the paradigm shift in agronomy, is published in volume 55 of Experimental Agriculture and covers the page range of 1–13.",

      "erosionkg_answer": "According to the provided references, the 'Options by Context' approach is mentioned in Source 4 (Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206) as a paradigm shift in agronomy, introduced by Sinclair and Coe in 2019. The specific volume and page range values for the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study are not provided in the references. However, it is mentioned that the study is published in Experimental Agriculture, Volume 55 (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206).\n\nRegarding the guide for applying the 'Options by Context' approach, Source 4 (Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206) mentions an illustrated five-step guide, titled \"Supporting Farmer Innovation to Restore: An Illustrated Five-Step Guide to Applying the Options by Context Approach to Land Restoration\". Therefore, the guide defines 5 steps for applying the 'Options by Context' approach (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206).\n\nIn summary, the 'Options by Context' approach is a paradigm shift in agronomy introduced by Sinclair and Coe in 2019, and there is a five-step guide for applying this approach to land restoration (Source: Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Adaptation for Small-Scale Land Users in Sub-Saharan Africa, Page: 27 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206).",

      "baseline_answer": "Based on the provided context, the specific question about the 'Options by Context' approach and the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study cannot be directly answered. The references provided do not mention the 'Options by Context' approach or the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study.\n\nHowever, reference 83 (Thomas et al., 2018) mentions \"A Framework for Scaling Sustainable Land Management Options,\" which might be related to the concept of 'Options by Context.' But, the exact steps defined in the guide for applying this approach are not specified in the provided context.\n\nAdditionally, there is no mention of a 2019 Sinclair and Coe study in the provided references, so the specific volume and page range values for this study cannot be determined.\n\nIn summary, the provided context does not contain the necessary information to answer the question about the 'Options by Context' approach and the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study. More specific references or context would be required to provide a detailed answer.",
