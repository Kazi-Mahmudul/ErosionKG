# Qualitative Case Studies

**Purpose:** Demonstrate the practical advantages of ErosionKG GraphRAG over baseline vector-only RAG through representative examples.

## Case Study 1: Hallucination Prevention

**Question (ID 1, Complexity: Low)**  
According to the references provided for land restoration and sustainable management, how many steps are defined in the guide for applying the 'Options by Context' approach, and what are the specific volume and page range values for the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study that details this paradigm shift?

**Expected Sources:**  
- https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061206

### Standard RAG Response
Based on the provided context, the specific question about the number of steps defined in the guide for applying the 'Options by Context' approach and the details of the 2019 Sinclair and Coe study cannot be directly answered. The references provided do not mention the "Options by Context" approach or a study by Sinclair and Coe in 2019.

However, reference 83 (Thomas, R.; Reed, M.; Clifton, K.; Appadurai, N.; Mills, A.; Zucca, C.; Kodsi, E.; Sircely, J.; Haddad, F.; Hagen, C.; et al. A Framework for Scaling Sustainable Land Management Options. Land Degrad. Dev. 2018, 29, 3272–3284) mentions a framework for scaling sustainable land management options, which might be related to the concept of applying options by context, but it does not provide the specific information requested.

Additionally, none of the provided references mention a study by Sinclair and Coe in 2019, or any specific volume and page range values for such a study. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the question based on the given context.
